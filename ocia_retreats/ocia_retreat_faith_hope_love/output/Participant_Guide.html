<p><strong>1. Human Virtues</strong>
- Cardinal Virtues: Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, Temperance
- Other Human Virtues: Patience, Humility, Chastity, Generosity, Kindness, Gratitude, Honesty, Compassion
- Can be acquired through human effort and practice
- Reach full perfection only when animated by grace and the theological virtues
- Rooted in the theological virtues (CCC 1812)</p>
<p><strong>2. Theological Virtues</strong>
- Faith, Hope, and Love (Charity)
- <em>Infused</em> by God into our souls—He is their author and source
- Enable us to love God and neighbor
- We receive them, cooperate with them, and grow in them through grace</p>

<p><strong>1. God is their ORIGIN</strong>
- God infuses them directly into our souls
- We don't obtain them through willpower—they are pure gift</p>
<p><strong>2. God is their OBJECT</strong>
- Faith believes <em>in God</em>
- Hope trusts <em>in God's promises</em>
- Love loves <em>God</em> above all else</p>
<p><strong>3. God is their MOTIVE</strong>
- We practice them <em>because of who God is</em>
- Not to earn rewards or avoid punishment</p>
<p><strong>CCC 1813:</strong> <em>"The theological virtues are the foundation of Christian moral activity; they animate it and give it its special character. They inform and give life to all the moral virtues. They are infused by God into the souls of the faithful to make them capable of acting as his children and of meriting eternal life."</em></p>

<h2 id="key-takeaway">Key Takeaway</h2>
<p>Grace is the <strong>foundation</strong> of everything else. Faith, hope, and love are only possible because God <strong>first gives us his grace</strong>.</p>
<p>The question isn't <em>"Am I good enough for God?"</em></p>
<p>The question is <em>"Will I receive what God's gift of His self?"</em></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="my-response">My Response</h2>
<p><em>One thing I want to remember about this lesson:</em></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<h2 id="prayer-for-grace">Prayer for Grace</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Jesus, I cannot save myself. I cannot transform myself. I cannot earn your love. But I can receive it. Open my heart to your grace. Help me to stop striving and start receiving. Apart from you, I can do nothing. With you, all things are possible. <strong>Amen.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"But God, who is rich in mercy, because of the great love he had for us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, brought us to life with Christ."</em>
— Ephesians 2:4-5 (NABRE)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-gift-you-cannot-earn">The Gift You Cannot Earn</h2>
<p>You are sitting in the midst of Love Himself.</p>
<p>The God who created the universe—who holds every star in place, who knows every hair on your head—is here. And He is not here to judge you, to fix you, or to demand something from you. He is here to give Himself to you.</p>
<p>This is grace.</p>
<p>You have learned that God exists, that He is Trinity—a communion of love. You have seen His covenant plan unfold through history, culminating in Jesus Christ. You have discovered the Church, the sacraments, the Mass. You know <em>about</em> God.</p>
<p>But grace is how you come to know God <em>personally</em>. Grace is not a thing God gives. Grace is God giving <em>Himself</em>. Right now, in this moment, the infinite God is pouring out His divine life toward you—not because you've earned it, not because you deserve it, but simply because He loves you.</p>
<p><strong>St. Thérèse of Lisieux</strong> understood this when she wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"It is not because I have been preserved from mortal sin that I lift up my heart to God in trust and love. I feel that even if I had on my conscience every crime one could commit, I would lose nothing of my confidence. Heartbroken with repentance, I would simply throw myself into my Savior's arms."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you receive this? Can you let go of the need to earn, to prove, to be worthy—and simply receive?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="grace-and-the-virtues-the-foundation-of-everything">Grace and the Virtues: The Foundation of Everything</h2>
<p>Today we begin a journey through the theological virtues: <strong>Faith, Hope, and Love</strong>. But before we can believe, before we can hope, before we can love—we must first receive.</p>
<p>Grace is the foundation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Faith</strong> is possible because grace opens our eyes to see God.</li>
<li><strong>Hope</strong> is possible because grace assures us of God's promises.</li>
<li><strong>Love</strong> is possible because grace pours God's own love into our hearts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without grace, we cannot take a single step toward God. But <em>with</em> grace, everything becomes possible.</p>
<p><strong>St. Augustine</strong>, who knew the depths of his own weakness, wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"God does not command the impossible, but in commanding He admonishes you to do what you can, and to ask for what you cannot do, and He helps you so that you can do it."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are not alone. You have never been alone. God's grace surrounds you, sustains you, and empowers you for everything He calls you to.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="reflection-questions">Reflection Questions</h2>
<p><em>Sit quietly with Jesus. Let these questions rest in your heart. You don't need to answer them—just let them open you to God's presence.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>1. Where have I been trying to earn God's love?</strong></p>
<p>What would it mean to stop striving and simply receive?</p>
<p><em>My thoughts:</em></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<p><strong>2. What weakness am I ashamed of?</strong></p>
<p>Can I bring it to Jesus right now and hear Him say, "My grace is sufficient for you"?</p>
<p><em>My thoughts:</em></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<p><strong>3. How is God inviting me to trust Him more deeply?</strong></p>
<p>Grace is the beginning—faith, hope, and love will follow.</p>
<p><em>My thoughts:</em></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<h2 id="a-prayer-of-surrender">A Prayer of Surrender</h2>
<p><em>Pray this slowly, from your heart:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lord Jesus, I come to You just as I am.</strong></p>
<p>I have nothing to offer You but my need.
I cannot earn Your love. I cannot deserve Your grace.
But I can receive.</p>
<p>Help me to receive.</p>
<p>Open my hands that have been clenched in striving.
Open my heart that has been closed in shame.
Open my soul to the flood of Your mercy.</p>
<p>I believe that Your grace is enough.
I believe that Your love is real.
I believe that You are here, right now, giving Yourself to me.</p>
<p>Jesus, I trust in You.</p>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="rest-in-his-presence">Rest in His Presence</h2>
<p><em>Now, set aside this booklet.</em></p>
<p>You have reflected. You have prayed. But the most important thing is simply to <em>be</em> with Jesus.</p>
<p>He is here—truly present in the Blessed Sacrament before you. You don't need words. You don't need to figure anything out. Just rest in His presence. Let Him look at you with love. Speak to Him from your heart—whatever comes naturally. Or simply be still and know that He is God.</p>
<p><strong>Remain here in silence until the bell rings.</strong></p>
<p>When you hear the bell, pray the closing prayer below, then return quietly to the Parish Hall.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="closing-prayer-the-anima-christi">Closing Prayer: The Anima Christi</h2>
<p><em>This ancient prayer, beloved by St. Ignatius of Loyola, is a perfect way to close your time with Jesus. It asks Christ to sanctify us with His grace—the very gift we have been reflecting on.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Soul of Christ, sanctify me.</strong>
Body of Christ, save me.
Blood of Christ, inebriate me.
Water from the side of Christ, wash me.
Passion of Christ, strengthen me.
O good Jesus, hear me.
Within your wounds, hide me.
Permit me not to be separated from you.
From the wicked foe, defend me.
At the hour of my death, call me
and bid me come to you,
that with your saints I may praise you
forever and ever.
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>We do not walk this journey alone. The saints who have gone before us intercede for us. Ask for their prayers:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Holy Mary, Mother of God, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
<p>St. John Paul II, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
<p>St. Thérèse of Lisieux, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
<p>St. Augustine, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
<p>St. Ignatius of Loyola, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
<p>All holy men and women, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="as-you-leave">As You Leave</h2>
<p><em>While making the Sign of the Cross, pray:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank you, Lord. I receive Your grace.</strong>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don't need to feel anything special. You don't need to have had a profound experience. Grace works whether we feel it or not.</p>
<p>Go in peace. The journey continues.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The father's prayer: <em>"I believe; help my unbelief!"</em>—the most <strong>honest</strong> prayer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Faith is a <strong>gift from God</strong>—we can't manufacture it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But we must <strong>choose</strong> to receive it and cooperate with it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Doubt</strong> is not the opposite of faith—<strong>refusal</strong> is the opposite of faith</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How Faith Grows:</strong>
- Prayer—asking God for more faith
- The sacraments—especially Eucharist and Confession
- Scripture and the teaching of the Church
- Community with other believers
- Acting on the faith we have</p>
<p><strong>How Faith Weakens:</strong>
- Neglecting prayer and the sacraments
- Surrounding ourselves only with unbelief
- Refusing to act on what we know to be true
- Letting other things become more important than God</p>

<p>You have been on a journey. You have learned that God exists, that He answers the problem of evil with love. You have encountered the Trinity, traced God's covenant plan, and met Jesus Christ—the Answer Incarnate. You have discovered the Church, Scripture, Tradition, the Mass, the saints.</p>
<p>You know so much more than when you started. And yet—knowing is not the same as believing.</p>
<p>Faith is not pretending to be certain when you're not. Faith is not checking your brain at the door. Faith is responding to a God who has already reached out to you—a God who reveals Himself through Scripture and Tradition, through the Church, through the sacraments—and waits for your response.</p>
<p><strong>St. John Henry Newman</strong> described his own journey this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Ten thousand difficulties do not make one doubt."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can have questions. You can struggle. You can wrestle. That's not the opposite of faith—that's often how faith grows. What matters is that you keep turning toward the One who created you, who loves you, who is calling you to a life in Him.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="faith-built-on-grace">Faith Built on Grace</h2>
<p>In our first session, we reflected on grace—God's free gift of Himself. Now we see that faith is our response to that gift.</p>
<p>Grace comes first. Always. God reveals Himself before we seek Him. God loves us before we love Him. God calls us before we answer.</p>
<p>Faith is simply saying <em>yes</em> to what God has already done.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grace</strong> is God reaching out to us.</li>
<li><strong>Faith</strong> is us reaching back.</li>
<li><strong>Hope</strong> will be trusting where that relationship leads.</li>
<li><strong>Love</strong> will be living fully in that relationship.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without grace, we could not believe. But grace has been given. The question now is: Will you believe?</p>
<p><strong>St. Augustine</strong>, after years of running from God, finally surrendered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Late have I loved you, Beauty so ancient and so new, late have I loved you! You were within me, but I was outside... You called, you shouted, and you broke through my deafness."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God is calling. He is breaking through. Faith is hearing that call and responding.</p>

<h2 id="reflection-questions">Reflection Questions</h2>
<p><em>Sit quietly with Jesus. Let these questions rest in your heart.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>1. What has God done to reveal Himself to me?</strong></p>
<p>A person? An experience? A longing that won't go away?</p>
<p><em>My thoughts:</em></p>

<hr />
<hr />
<hr />

I bring You my whole self—not just the parts that feel ready.</p>
<p>You have revealed Yourself to me in ways I'm only beginning to understand.

<h2 id="rest-in-his-presence">Rest in His Presence</h2>
<p><em>Now, set aside this booklet.</em></p>
<p>You have reflected. You have prayed. But the most important thing is simply to <em>be</em> with Jesus.</p>
<p>He is here—truly present in the Blessed Sacrament before you. You don't need to have all the answers. You don't need perfect faith. Just be with the One who is calling you. Speak to Him from your heart—your doubts, your hopes, your desire to believe. Or simply be still and let Him speak to you.</p>
<p><strong>Remain here in silence until the bell rings.</strong></p>
<p>When you hear the bell, pray the closing prayer below, then return quietly to the Parish Hall.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="closing-prayer-the-anima-christi">Closing Prayer: The Anima Christi</h2>
<p><em>Ask Christ to deepen your faith as you pray:</em></p>

Blood of Christ, inebriate me.
Water from the side of Christ, wash me.
Passion of Christ, strengthen me.
O good Jesus, hear me.
Within your wounds, hide me.
Permit me not to be separated from you.
From the wicked foe, defend me.
At the hour of my death, call me
and bid me come to you,
that with your saints I may praise you
forever and ever.
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>We do not walk this journey alone. The saints who have gone before us intercede for us. Ask for their prayers:</em></p>

<p><em>One thing I want to remember about this lesson:</em></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<h2 id="act-of-hope">Act of Hope</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>O my God, relying on your infinite goodness and promises, I hope to obtain pardon of my sins, the help of your grace, and life everlasting, through the merits of Jesus Christ, my Lord and Redeemer. <strong>Amen.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"Hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the holy Spirit that has been given to us."</em>
— Romans 5:5 (NABRE)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-anchor-that-holds">The Anchor That Holds</h2>
<p>Life is hard. You know this.</p>
<p>You have learned that God exists—and that evil and suffering are real. You have seen how God's answer to suffering is love: truth, justice, and mercy woven together. You have traced His covenant faithfulness through history, even when His people failed Him again and again.</p>
<p>God does not abandon. God keeps His promises. This is the foundation of hope.</p>
<p>And yet—there are days when the weight feels unbearable. Anxiety about the future. Grief over the past. Discouragement in the present. The state of the world. The struggles in your own life. Moments when you wonder if things will ever change.</p>
<p>And yet—you are here. You have not given up. Something in you keeps reaching for the light.</p>
<p>That something is hope.</p>
<p>Hope is not optimism. Optimism says, "Things will probably work out." Hope says, "God is faithful, no matter what happens." Optimism depends on circumstances. Hope depends on God.</p>
<p>Jesus said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give it to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled or afraid."</em> (John 14:27, NABRE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>St. Padre Pio</strong> wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Pray, hope, and don't worry. Worry is useless. God is merciful and will hear your prayer."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>St. Thomas Aquinas</strong> defined hope this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Hope is the theological virtue by which we desire the kingdom of heaven and eternal life as our happiness, placing our trust in Christ's promises and relying not on our own strength, but on the help of the grace of the Holy Spirit."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice: hope relies <em>not on our own strength</em>. This is crucial. Hope is not about being strong enough to endure. Hope is about trusting a God who is strong enough to carry us.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="hope-built-on-grace-and-faith">Hope Built on Grace and Faith</h2>
<p>We have journeyed through grace—God's free gift of Himself. We have said yes in faith—believing that God is who He says He is. Now hope takes us further.</p>
<p>Hope is faith looking forward.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grace</strong> is God giving Himself to us.</li>
<li><strong>Faith</strong> is believing that gift is real.</li>
<li><strong>Hope</strong> is trusting that God will complete what He has begun.</li>
<li><strong>Love</strong> will be living fully in that completion.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>St. Paul</strong> understood this progression when he wrote to the Philippians:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I am confident of this, that the one who began a good work in you will continue to complete it until the day of Christ Jesus."</em> (Philippians 1:6, NABRE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God has begun something in you. Hope trusts that He will finish it.</p>

I come to You because Your promises are true.
I come to You because You are my only hope.</p>

<h2 id="the-destination-of-the-journey">The Destination of the Journey</h2>
<p>You have traveled far—not just today, but throughout your entire OCIA journey.</p>
<p>You learned that God exists and that the solution to evil and suffering is love. You discovered that love is not a feeling but a reality that binds truth, justice, and mercy together. You met the Trinity—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—an eternal communion of love. You traced God's covenant plan, saw it fulfilled in Jesus Christ, and found it alive in the Church, the Mass, the sacraments.</p>
<p>Everything you have learned has been pointing here. To love.</p>
<p>Today you began with grace—the overwhelming gift of God pouring out His very life toward you. You responded with faith—saying yes to a God who reveals Himself. You anchored yourself in hope—trusting that God will complete what He has begun.</p>
<p>Now you arrive at the destination: Love.</p>
<p>But here is the beautiful truth—love is not just the destination. Love has been with you all along. Grace <em>is</em> love reaching out. Faith <em>is</em> love received. Hope <em>is</em> love trusted. And now, love calls you to <em>remain</em>.</p>
<p><strong>St. John</strong> understood this when he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"In this is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as expiation for our sins."</em> (1 John 4:10, NABRE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Love begins with God. Always. You are not here to earn God's love. You are here to receive it, to rest in it, and to let it transform you.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="god-is-love">God IS Love</h2>
<p>St. Paul wrote that faith, hope, and love abide—but <em>the greatest of these is love</em> (1 Corinthians 13:13).</p>
<p>Why is love the greatest?</p>
<p>Because love is who God <em>is</em>. Not just what God does—who God <em>is</em>. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are an eternal communion of self-giving love. And this love—this very love—has been pursuing you your entire life. Before you knew His name. Before you walked through the doors of this parish. Before you took your first breath. God's love was there.</p>
<p><strong>St. Augustine</strong> captured this beautifully:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The restlessness you have felt—the longing, the searching, the ache for something more—that is your heart seeking the love it was made for. And that love is here. That love is now. That love is Jesus, present before you.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="called-to-be-love-in-the-world">Called to Be Love in the World</h2>
<p>But God does not call you simply to receive His love. He calls you to <em>become</em> His love in the world.</p>
<p>The prophet Micah asked what the Lord requires of us. The answer echoes through the ages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"You have been told, O mortal, what is good, and what the LORD requires of you: Only to do justice and to love goodness, and to walk humbly with your God."</em> (Micah 6:8, NABRE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is your calling. This is why you are here. Not just to know about God's love, but to <em>be</em> God's love—to bear truth in a world drowning in lies, to do justice where injustice reigns, to love mercy when the world demands vengeance, and to walk humbly with your God every step of the way.</p>
<p>Jesus gave everything for you. Now He invites you to give your whole life to Him.</p>
<p><strong>St. John of the Cross</strong> wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"In the evening of life, we will be judged on love alone."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not on how much we knew. Not on how much we accomplished. Not on how impressive our faith appeared. On love. Only love.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-next-generation">The Next Generation</h2>
<p>Look around you. The world is dark. But you—<em>you</em>—are called to be light.</p>
<p>Jesus said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"You are the light of the world. A city set on a mountain cannot be hidden."</em> (Matthew 5:14, NABRE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are the next generation that brings light into the darkness. You are the ones who will carry the faith forward. You are the hands and feet of Christ in a world that desperately needs to see His love made visible.</p>
<p>This is not a burden. This is a gift. This is the adventure you were made for.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="reflection-questions">Reflection Questions</h2>
<p><em>Sit quietly with Jesus. Let these questions rest in your heart.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>1. Do I truly believe that God—who IS love—has been pursuing me my whole life?</strong></p>
<p>How does this change the way I see my past, my present, my future?</p>
<p><em>My thoughts:</em></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<p><strong>2. Am I willing to give my whole life to Christ, as He gave His life for me?</strong></p>
<p>What am I still holding back? What would it look like to surrender completely?</p>
<p><em>My thoughts:</em></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<p><strong>3. How is God calling me to be His love in the world?</strong></p>
<p>To bear truth? To do justice? To love mercy? To walk humbly? Where is He sending me?</p>
<p><em>My thoughts:</em></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<p><strong>4. Will I accept the call to be light in the darkness?</strong></p>
<p>The world needs what you have received. Will you share it?</p>
<p><em>My thoughts:</em></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<h2 id="a-prayer-of-total-surrender">A Prayer of Total Surrender</h2>
<p><em>Pray this slowly, from your heart:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lord Jesus, You are Love.</strong></p>
<p>You loved me before I knew You.
You loved me when I ran from You.
You love me now, in all my weakness and failure.</p>
<p>I give You my whole life.
Not part of it. Not the easy parts. All of it.
As You gave Yourself completely for me, I give myself completely to You.</p>
<p>Make me Your love in the world.
Send me to bear truth where there are lies.
Send me to do justice where there is oppression.
Send me to love mercy where there is cruelty.
Teach me to walk humbly with You every day.</p>
<p>I am Yours. Use me. Send me. I am ready.</p>
<p><em>"You have been told, O mortal, what is good, and what the LORD requires of you: Only to do justice and to love goodness, and to walk humbly with your God."</em> (Micah 6:8)</p>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="traditional-prayer-act-of-love">Traditional Prayer: Act of Love</h2>
<p><em>This ancient prayer expresses the heart of charity—loving God above all and neighbor for God's sake. Pray it slowly, letting each phrase become your own.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>O my God, I love you above all things, with my whole heart and soul, because you are all good and worthy of all my love.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I love my neighbor as myself for the love of you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I forgive all who have injured me, and I ask pardon of all whom I have injured.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="rest-in-his-presence">Rest in His Presence</h2>
<p><em>Now, set aside this booklet.</em></p>
<p>You have reflected. You have prayed. But the most important thing is simply to <em>be</em> with Jesus—Love Himself.</p>
<p>He is here—truly present in the Blessed Sacrament before you. You don't need to do anything. You don't need to prove anything. Just rest in the arms of the Jesus who loves you more than you can imagine. Speak to Him from your heart—your gratitude, your surrender, your desire to love as He loves. Or simply be still and receive His love.</p>
<p><strong>Remain here in silence until the bell rings.</strong></p>
<p>When you hear the bell, pray the closing prayer below, then return quietly to the Parish Hall.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="closing-prayer-the-anima-christi">Closing Prayer: The Anima Christi</h2>
<p><em>Ask Christ to fill you with His love as you pray:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Soul of Christ, sanctify me.</strong>
Body of Christ, save me.
Blood of Christ, inebriate me.
Water from the side of Christ, wash me.
Passion of Christ, strengthen me.
O good Jesus, hear me.
Within your wounds, hide me.
Permit me not to be separated from you.
From the wicked foe, defend me.
At the hour of my death, call me
and bid me come to you,
that with your saints I may praise you
forever and ever.
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>We do not walk this journey alone. The saints who have gone before us intercede for us. Ask for their prayers:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Holy Mary, Queen of Heaven, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
<p>St. John Paul II, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
<p>St. Augustine, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
<p>St. John of the Cross, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
<p>All holy men and women, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="as-you-leave">As You Leave</h2>
<p><em>While making the Sign of the Cross, pray:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lord, help me to love as You love.</strong>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have received grace. You have said yes in faith. You have anchored yourself in hope. Now go and love—for love is why you were made.</p>
<p>Go in peace. The journey continues—and love leads the way.</p>
