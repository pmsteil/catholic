<p>Before the retreat, pray together as a team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Jesus, we place this retreat in Your hands.
We are not the ones who will change hearts—You are.
Help us to decrease so that You may increase.
Give us wisdom, patience, and love.
Protect this day from distraction and disruption.
Let every participant encounter Your love.
Mary, Mother of the Church, pray for us.
St. John Paul II, pray for us.
St. Thérèse of Lisieux, pray for us.
St. Augustine, pray for us.
St. Ignatius of Loyola, pray for us.
St. John Henry Newman, pray for us.
St. John of the Cross, pray for us.
All holy men and women, pray for us.
Amen.</p>

<h2 id="retreat-purpose">Retreat Purpose</h2>
<p>This retreat is designed to help catechumens in the Catechumenate stage deepen their understanding of how they personally receive and respond to God's love through <strong>grace</strong> and the <strong>theological virtues of faith, hope, and love</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="participant-background">Participant Background</h2>
<p>These catechumens have already completed instruction on:
- The existence of God and the problem of evil
- Love as the integration of truth, justice, and mercy
- The dignity of the human person
- The Blessed Trinity
- God's covenant plan
- Jesus Christ
- The Church and its four marks
- Scripture and Tradition
- The Mass
- Mary and the Communion of Saints
- The Sacramental Economy</p>
<p><strong>This retreat builds on that foundation</strong> by focusing on the personal encounter with God.</p>
<h2 id="retreat-goals">Retreat Goals</h2>
<p>By the end of this retreat, participants should:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Understand Grace</strong> — Know that grace is God's free gift of His divine life, not something we earn</li>
<li><strong>Embrace Faith</strong> — Recognize faith as a response to God's self-revelation</li>
<li><strong>Cultivate Hope</strong> — Distinguish Christian hope from mere optimism</li>
<li><strong>Live Love</strong> — See love as the greatest virtue that integrates all others</li>
<li><strong>Experience Encounter</strong> — Have personal time with Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Retreat Verse:</strong> <em>"So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love."</em> (1 Corinthians 13:13 NABRE)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="session-overview">Session Overview</h2>
<h2 id="part-1-teaching-30-minutes">Part 1: Teaching (30 minutes)</h2>
<h3 id="central-truth">Central Truth</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>God gives his own life and friendship to us. We call this gift grace. We do not earn or deserve God's grace. Grace allows us to become God's adopted children and to respond to his abundant love.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="opening-3-minutes">Opening (3 minutes)</h3>
<p>Begin with this question to the group: <em>"Have you ever received a gift so extravagant, so undeserved, that you didn't know how to respond?"</em></p>
<p>That's what we're talking about today. Grace is God giving us <em>himself</em>—not just blessings, not just help, but his very life.</p>
<h3 id="talking-point-1-what-grace-actually-is-8-minutes">Talking Point 1: What Grace Actually Is (8 minutes)</h3>
<p><strong>Primary Scripture: Ephesians 2:4-10 (NABRE)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"But God, who is rich in mercy, because of the great love he had for us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, brought us to life with Christ (by grace you have been saved), raised us up with him, and seated us with him in the heavens in Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not from you; it is the gift of God; it is not from works, so no one may boast. For we are his handiwork, created in Christ Jesus for the good works that God has prepared in advance, that we should live in them."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key points to emphasize:</strong>
- Grace is not a thing—it's God's own divine life shared with us
- In the beginning, God created us and endowed us with grace—but it was lost by Adam's sin (original sin)
- We were <em>dead</em> in sin. Dead people can't save themselves. God made us alive.
- Jesus came to restore God's grace to us; we receive all grace by the merit of his Paschal mystery (death and resurrection)
- This is pure gift. We didn't earn it. We can't earn it. We can only receive it.
- Grace makes us God's adopted children—not servants, not employees, but <em>sons and daughters</em></p>
<p><strong>CCC 1996:</strong> <em>"Grace is favor, the free and undeserved help that God gives us to respond to his call to become children of God."</em></p>
<h3 id="talking-point-2-how-grace-works-in-us-8-minutes">Talking Point 2: How Grace Works in Us (8 minutes)</h3>
<p><strong>Primary Scripture: John 15:1-5 (NABRE)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I am the true vine, and my Father is the vine grower. He takes away every branch in me that does not bear fruit, and every one that does he prunes so that it bears more fruit. You are already pruned because of the word that I spoke to you. Remain in me, as I remain in you. Just as a branch cannot bear fruit on its own unless it remains on the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in me. I am the vine, you are the branches. Whoever remains in me and I in him will bear much fruit, because without me you can do nothing."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key points to emphasize:</strong>
- Grace isn't just a one-time gift at Baptism—it's an ongoing relationship
- Like a branch connected to the vine, we receive <strong>life continuously from Christ</strong>
- <em>"Apart from me you can do nothing"</em>—this is humbling but also liberating
- The sacraments are the primary channels through which grace flows to us
- We can cooperate with grace or resist it—God respects our freedom
- Grace flows from God the Vine to us the branches like nourishment—and the fruit we bear is the natural result of staying connected to Him. No vine? No love, no fruit, no life.</p>
<p><strong>Two essential types of grace to know:</strong>
- <strong>Sanctifying grace</strong> — God's life dwelling permanently in us; received at Baptism, restored in Confession
- <strong>Actual grace</strong> — God's help in specific moments to do good and avoid evil</p>
<h3 id="talking-point-3-why-this-changes-everything-8-minutes">Talking Point 3: Why This Changes Everything (8 minutes)</h3>
<p><strong>Primary Scripture: 2 Corinthians 12:9 (NABRE)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.' I will rather boast most gladly of my weaknesses, in order that the power of Christ may dwell with me."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key points to emphasize:</strong>
- St. Paul begged God three times to remove his "thorn in the flesh"
- God's answer: <em>"My grace is sufficient."</em> Not "I'll fix your problem" but "I am enough."
- This means: In your weakness, in your struggle, in your failure—God's grace is enough
- Grace transforms us from the inside out—new intellect, new will, new capacity to love
- We become capable of things we could never do on our own</p>
<p><strong>The stakes:</strong>
- Sanctifying grace can be lost through mortal sin
- It is restored through the Sacrament of Reconciliation
- We increase in grace by prayer, the sacraments, and acts of love</p>
<h3 id="closing-3-minutes">Closing (3 minutes)</h3>
<p>Grace is the foundation of everything else we'll discuss today. Faith, hope, and love are only possible because God first gives us his grace.</p>
<p>The question isn't "Am I good enough for God?" The question is "Will I receive what God is offering?"</p>
<p>Now we're going to send you to spend time with Jesus in the Sanctuary. As you sit before him in the Blessed Sacrament, bring to him whatever is on your heart about grace—your need for it, your struggle to receive it, your gratitude for it. Just be with him.</p>
<p><strong>Let us pray</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Jesus, you have taught us about your grace—your very life poured out for us. Now send us to sit at your feet. As we enter your presence in the Blessed Sacrament, open our hearts to receive what we cannot earn. Help us to simply be with you, the Vine, so that your life may flow into us, the branches. We go now to receive your Grace. In your holy name we pray. Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Please proceed quietly to the Sanctuary.</em></p>

<p><em>Use this material if you finish early or if participants want to explore further during discussion.</em></p>
<h3 id="additional-types-of-grace">Additional Types of Grace</h3>
<p>Beyond sanctifying and actual grace, the Church teaches about several other forms:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Sacramental grace</strong> — The particular grace proper to each sacrament; the seven sacraments are the primary channels through which grace flows to us (CCC 1129)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Charism</strong> — Special gifts of grace given by the Holy Spirit for the building up of the Church and the salvation of others (CCC 799-801)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Justification</strong> — The action of the Holy Spirit in us that makes us holy; our sins are truly forgiven and taken away, not merely covered over (CCC 1987-1995)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Graces of state</strong> — Special graces given to help us fulfill the duties of our particular vocation (married, single, religious, ordained) (CCC 2004)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what-grace-produces-in-us">What Grace Produces in Us</h3>
<p><strong>The Gifts of the Holy Spirit</strong> (Isaiah 11:2-3):
- Wisdom, Understanding, Counsel, Fortitude, Knowledge, Piety, Fear of the Lord</p>
<p><strong>The Fruits of the Spirit</strong> (Galatians 5:22-23):
- Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control</p>
<p>These gifts and fruits are the natural result of staying connected to Christ the Vine. They are evidence that grace is at work in us.</p></div><div class="section"><h2>Group Discussion</h2><h1 id="session-1-grace-group-discussion-20-minutes">Session 1: Grace - Group Discussion (20 minutes)</h1>
<p><em>Participants return from the Sanctuary to share what God revealed to them during their time with Jesus.</em></p>
<h2 id="opening-question-what-is-god-showing-you-10-minutes">Opening Question: What Is God Showing You? (10 minutes)</h2>
<p><strong>"How is God helping you grow in your understanding of grace today? What revelations or insights did you receive during your time with Jesus?"</strong></p>
<p><em>Facilitator notes:</em>
- This is the primary question—give it space and time
- Let participants share freely what they experienced in prayer
- Some may have had profound insights; others may have simply rested
- All responses are valid—God works differently in each person
- Listen for themes that emerge across the group</p>
<h2 id="follow-up-questions-if-needed-10-minutes">Follow-Up Questions (if needed, 10 minutes)</h2>
<p><em>Use these only if the conversation needs prompting:</em></p>
<p><strong>"Where in your life right now do you most need to hear that God's grace is enough? What would it look like to actually believe that?"</strong></p>
<p><em>Facilitator notes:</em>
- Encourage specificity—not "my life in general" but "this relationship," "this struggle," "this fear"
- What would change if they truly believed grace was sufficient?</p>
<p><strong>"Many of us were raised to believe we have to earn everything we get. How does the idea that God's grace is completely free make you feel?"</strong></p>
<p><em>Facilitator notes:</em>
- Some may feel relief ("I don't have to be perfect")
- Others may feel uncomfortable ("If I can't earn it, how do I know I have it?")
- Guide toward understanding that receiving a gift requires humility, not achievement</p></div><div class="section"><h2>Devotional Guide</h2><h1 id="session-1-devotional-resting-in-gods-grace">Session 1 Devotional: Resting in God's Grace</h1>

— Ephesians 2:4-5 (NABRE)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-gift-you-cannot-earn">The Gift You Cannot Earn</h2>
<p>You are sitting in the midst of Love Himself.</p>
<p>The God who created the universe—who holds every star in place, who knows every hair on your head—is here. And He is not here to judge you, to fix you, or to demand something from you. He is here to give Himself to you.</p>
<p>This is grace.</p>
<p>You have learned that God exists, that He is Trinity—a communion of love. You have seen His covenant plan unfold through history, culminating in Jesus Christ. You have discovered the Church, the sacraments, the Mass. You know <em>about</em> God.</p>
<p>But grace is how you come to know God <em>personally</em>. Grace is not a thing God gives. Grace is God giving <em>Himself</em>. Right now, in this moment, the infinite God is pouring out His divine life toward you—not because you've earned it, not because you deserve it, but simply because He loves you.</p>
<p><strong>St. Thérèse of Lisieux</strong> understood this when she wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"It is not because I have been preserved from mortal sin that I lift up my heart to God in trust and love. I feel that even if I had on my conscience every crime one could commit, I would lose nothing of my confidence. Heartbroken with repentance, I would simply throw myself into my Savior's arms."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you receive this? Can you let go of the need to earn, to prove, to be worthy—and simply receive?</p>
<h2 id="grace-and-the-virtues-the-foundation-of-everything">Grace and the Virtues: The Foundation of Everything</h2>
<p>Today we begin a journey through the theological virtues: <strong>Faith, Hope, and Love</strong>. But before we can believe, before we can hope, before we can love—we must first receive.</p>
<p>Grace is the foundation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Faith</strong> is possible because grace opens our eyes to see God.</li>
<li><strong>Hope</strong> is possible because grace assures us of God's promises.</li>
<li><strong>Love</strong> is possible because grace pours God's own love into our hearts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without grace, we cannot take a single step toward God. But <em>with</em> grace, everything becomes possible.</p>
<p><strong>St. Augustine</strong>, who knew the depths of his own weakness, wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"God does not command the impossible, but in commanding He admonishes you to do what you can, and to ask for what you cannot do, and He helps you so that you can do it."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are not alone. You have never been alone. God's grace surrounds you, sustains you, and empowers you for everything He calls you to.</p>
<h2 id="reflection-questions">Reflection Questions</h2>
<p><em>Sit quietly with Jesus. Let these questions rest in your heart. You don't need to answer them—just let them open you to God's presence.</em></p>
<p><strong>1. Where have I been trying to earn God's love?</strong></p>
<p>What would it mean to stop striving and simply receive?</p>
<p><em>My thoughts:</em></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<p><strong>2. What weakness am I ashamed of?</strong></p>
<p>Can I bring it to Jesus right now and hear Him say, "My grace is sufficient for you"?</p>
<p><em>My thoughts:</em></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<p><strong>3. How is God inviting me to trust Him more deeply?</strong></p>
<p>Grace is the beginning—faith, hope, and love will follow.</p>
<p><em>My thoughts:</em></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<h2 id="a-prayer-of-surrender">A Prayer of Surrender</h2>
<p><em>Pray this slowly, from your heart:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lord Jesus, I come to You just as I am.</strong></p>
<p>I have nothing to offer You but my need.
I cannot earn Your love. I cannot deserve Your grace.
But I can receive.</p>
<p>Help me to receive.</p>
<p>Open my hands that have been clenched in striving.
Open my heart that has been closed in shame.
Open my soul to the flood of Your mercy.</p>
<p>I believe that Your grace is enough.
I believe that Your love is real.
I believe that You are here, right now, giving Yourself to me.</p>
<p>Jesus, I trust in You.</p>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="rest-in-his-presence">Rest in His Presence</h2>
<p><em>Now, set aside this booklet.</em></p>
<p>You have reflected. You have prayed. But the most important thing is simply to <em>be</em> with Jesus.</p>
<p>He is here—truly present in the Blessed Sacrament before you. You don't need words. You don't need to figure anything out. Just rest in His presence. Let Him look at you with love. Speak to Him from your heart—whatever comes naturally. Or simply be still and know that He is God.</p>
<p><strong>Remain here in silence until the bell rings.</strong></p>
<p>When you hear the bell, pray the closing prayer below, then return quietly to the Parish Hall.</p>
<h2 id="closing-prayer-the-anima-christi">Closing Prayer: The Anima Christi</h2>
<p><em>This ancient prayer, beloved by St. Ignatius of Loyola, is a perfect way to close your time with Jesus. It asks Christ to sanctify us with His grace—the very gift we have been reflecting on.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Soul of Christ, sanctify me.</strong>
Body of Christ, save me.
Blood of Christ, inebriate me.
Water from the side of Christ, wash me.
Passion of Christ, strengthen me.
O good Jesus, hear me.
Within your wounds, hide me.
Permit me not to be separated from you.
From the wicked foe, defend me.
At the hour of my death, call me
and bid me come to you,
that with your saints I may praise you
forever and ever.
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>We do not walk this journey alone. The saints who have gone before us intercede for us. Ask for their prayers:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Holy Mary, Mother of God, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
<p>St. John Paul II, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
<p>St. Thérèse of Lisieux, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
<p>St. Augustine, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
<p>St. Ignatius of Loyola, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
<p>All holy men and women, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="as-you-leave">As You Leave</h2>
<p><em>While making the Sign of the Cross, pray:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank you, Lord. I receive Your grace.</strong>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don't need to feel anything special. You don't need to have had a profound experience. Grace works whether we feel it or not.</p>
<p>Go in peace. The journey continues.</p>

<h2 id="session-overview">Session Overview</h2>
<h2 id="part-1-teaching-30-minutes">Part 1: Teaching (30 minutes)</h2>
<h3 id="central-truth">Central Truth</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We believe because God, the Author of Creation, reality, truth, love  reveals all that is true, good, and beautiful. Our response is a gift of his grace. We must remain steadfast in faith to see God.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="opening-3-minutes">Opening (3 minutes)</h3>
<p><em>Connect to Session 1:</em> We just talked about grace—God giving us his very life. But how do we receive that gift? Through faith. Faith is how we say "yes" to what God is offering.</p>
<p>Ask the group: <em>"What's the difference between knowing about someone and actually trusting them?"</em></p>
<p>That's the difference between information about God and faith in God.</p>
<h3 id="key-terms-to-know">Key Terms to Know</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Theological Virtues:</strong> Faith, hope, and love—infused by God at Baptism, directed toward God Himself, and necessary for salvation (CCC 1812-1813)</li>
<li><strong>Deposit of Faith:</strong> The heritage of faith contained in Sacred Scripture and Tradition, handed on in the Church from the Apostles—this is <em>what</em> we believe (CCC 84)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="talking-point-1-faith-is-personal-trust-not-just-information-8-minutes">Talking Point 1: Faith Is Personal Trust, Not Just Information (8 minutes)</h3>
<p><strong>Primary Scripture: John 14:1-6 (NABRE)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Do not let your hearts be troubled. You have faith in God; have faith also in me. In my Father's house there are many dwelling places. If there were not, would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back again and take you to myself, so that where I am you also may be. Where I am going you know the way." Thomas said to him, "Master, we do not know where you are going; how can we know the way?" Jesus said to him, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key points to emphasize:</strong>
- When you hear the word "faith" - think "trust in Jesus"
- The Greek word for faith (<em>pistis</em>) always orbits around trust—whether it's the act of trusting God, His trustworthiness, the proof that grounds our trust, or "the faith" (the content of what we trust Him for). It all points to personal trust in a Person.
- Jesus doesn't say "trust these facts about me"—he says "trust <em>in</em> me"
- Jesus claims to be <em>the</em> way—not <em>a</em> way. This is exclusive, but it's also an invitation.
- Faith is trust in His Grace - Trusting the Author of all that is true</p>
<p><strong>CCC 1814:</strong> <em>"Faith is the theological virtue by which we believe in God and believe all that he has said and revealed to us, and that Holy Church proposes for our belief, because he is truth itself. By faith 'man freely commits his entire self to God.' For this reason the believer seeks to know and do God's will. 'The righteous shall live by faith.' Living faith 'works through charity.'"</em></p>
<p><strong>CCC 1815:</strong> <em>"The gift of faith remains in one who has not sinned against it. But 'faith apart from works is dead': when it is deprived of hope and love, faith does not fully unite the believer to Christ and does not make him a living member of his Body."</em></p>
<p>Faith is not separate from love, but is the first step in truly loving God. Without trust, we cannot love.</p>
<p>Think about this in human terms: <strong>What happens when someone betrays your trust?</strong> Your ability to trust them is shattered. You can never be sure what they'll do. You can never be sure if they'll be there for you when you need them. Your ability to love them fully is broken.</p>
<p>But with God, our trust is well-placed. The key phrase: <em>"because he is truth itself."</em> We don't believe because we've figured everything out. We believe because God is Truth.</p>
<p><strong>Faith and reason work together:</strong> Faith is not a blind leap—it does not oppose reason. God is the source of both faith and reason, so they can never truly contradict each other (CCC 35). Reason prepares us for faith and helps us see its reasonableness; faith enlightens reason and opens us to truths beyond what reason alone can discover.</p>
<h3 id="talking-point-2-faith-is-a-gift-we-must-choose-to-receive-8-minutes">Talking Point 2: Faith Is a Gift We Must Choose to Receive (8 minutes)</h3>
<p><strong>Primary Scripture: Mark 9:21-24 (NABRE)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"And he asked his father, 'How long has this been happening to him?' He replied, 'Since childhood. It has often thrown him into fire and into water to kill him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.' Jesus said to him, '"If you can!" Everything is possible to one who has faith.' Then the boy's father cried out, 'I do believe, help my unbelief!'"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key points to emphasize:</strong>
- This father is honest: "I believe; help my unbelief!" This is the most honest prayer.
- Faith is a gift from God—we can't manufacture it on our own
- But we must <em>choose</em> to receive it and cooperate with it
- Faith can grow or shrink depending on how we nurture it</p>
<p><strong>Key insight from CCC 2089:</strong> Doubt is not the opposite of faith—<em>refusal</em> is the opposite of faith. We can have questions and still believe. What matters is whether we keep saying "yes" to God.</p>
<p><strong>Faith can grow or weaken</strong> depending on how we nurture it:
- It grows through prayer, the sacraments, Scripture, community, and acting on what we believe
- It weakens when we neglect these things or let other priorities crowd out God</p>
<h3 id="talking-point-3-faith-is-the-foundation-for-everything-else-8-minutes">Talking Point 3: Faith Is the Foundation for Everything Else (8 minutes)</h3>
<p><strong>Primary Scripture: Hebrews 11:1, 6 (NABRE)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Faith is the realization of what is hoped for and evidence of things not seen... But without faith it is impossible to please him, for anyone who approaches God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key points to emphasize:</strong>
- Faith is "assurance" and "conviction"—not wishful thinking, but confident trust
- We believe in things we cannot see—but that doesn't mean they're not real
- <em>"Without faith it is impossible to please God"</em>—this is sobering
- Faith is the door through which we enter relationship with God
- By faith, we believe; in hope, we trust his promises; in love, we respond</p>
<p><strong>The connection to love:</strong>
- Faith is not the end—it's the beginning
- Faith opens us to receive God's love
- Faith leads to hope, and hope leads to love
- "Faith working through love" (Galatians 5:6)—faith that doesn't lead to love isn't real faith</p>
<h3 id="closing-3-minutes">Closing (3 minutes)</h3>
<p>Faith is saying "yes" to God—yes to his existence, yes to his revelation, yes to his love. It's not a blind leap into the dark; it's a trusting step toward the Light.</p>
<p>The father in Mark's Gospel gives us the perfect prayer: <em>"I believe; help my unbelief!"</em> That's where most of us live—somewhere between belief and doubt. And Jesus doesn't reject that. He works with it.</p>
<p>Now we're going to send you to spend time with Jesus in the Sanctuary. As you sit before him in the Blessed Sacrament, bring to him whatever is stirring in your heart about faith—your doubts, your questions, your desire to trust more deeply. Just be with him.</p>
<p><strong>Let us pray</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Jesus, you are the Way, the Truth, and the Life. We have heard your call to faith—to trust in you, not just to know about you. Now send us into your presence. As we sit before you in the Blessed Sacrament, help us to bring our doubts, our fears, and our unbelief. Meet us there. Increase our faith. We go now to be with you, the One in whom we place our trust. In your holy name we pray. Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Please proceed quietly to the Sanctuary.</em></p>

<p><em>Use this material if you finish early or if participants want to explore further during discussion.</em></p>
<h3 id="sins-against-faith-ccc-2089">Sins Against Faith (CCC 2089)</h3>
<p>The Church identifies specific ways we can sin against faith:
- <strong>Incredulity</strong> — the refusal to believe
- <strong>Heresy</strong> — obstinate, post-baptismal rejection of a doctrine
- <strong>Apostasy</strong> — total rejection of the faith
- <strong>Schism</strong> — refusal to submit to the Roman Pontiff</p>
<h3 id="how-faith-grows-and-weakens">How Faith Grows and Weakens</h3>
<p><strong>How faith grows:</strong>
- Prayer—asking God for more faith
- The sacraments—especially Eucharist and Confession
- Scripture and the teaching of the Church
- Community with other believers
- Acting on the faith we have (faith without works is dead)</p>
<p><strong>How faith weakens:</strong>
- Neglecting prayer and the sacraments
- Surrounding ourselves only with unbelief
- Refusing to act on what we know to be true
- Letting other things become more important than God</p>
<h3 id="faith-as-spiritual-armor">Faith as Spiritual Armor</h3>
<p><strong>Ephesians 6:16 (NABRE):</strong> <em>"In all circumstances, hold faith as a shield, to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one."</em></p>
<p>Faith is not passive—it's spiritual armor. The enemy attacks with doubt, discouragement, and deception. Faith is our active defense, protecting us from lies that would separate us from God.</p></div><div class="section"><h2>Group Discussion</h2><h1 id="session-2-faith-group-discussion-20-minutes">Session 2: Faith - Group Discussion (20 minutes)</h1>
<p><em>Participants return from the Sanctuary to share what God revealed to them during their time with Jesus.</em></p>
<h2 id="opening-question-what-is-god-showing-you-10-minutes">Opening Question: What Is God Showing You? (10 minutes)</h2>
<p><strong>"How is God helping you grow in faith today? What revelations or insights did you receive during your time with Jesus?"</strong></p>
<p><em>Facilitator notes:</em>
- This is the primary question—give it space and time
- Let participants share freely what they experienced in prayer
- Some may have wrestled with doubts; others may have felt peace
- All responses are valid—God works differently in each person
- Listen for themes that emerge across the group</p>
<h2 id="follow-up-questions-if-needed-10-minutes">Follow-Up Questions (if needed, 10 minutes)</h2>
<p><em>Use these only if the conversation needs prompting:</em></p>
<p><strong>"What makes it hard for you to trust God? Is it something from your past? Something you've seen? Something you don't understand?"</strong></p>
<p><em>Facilitator notes:</em>
- This question invites honesty about obstacles to faith
- Common answers: past hurts, unanswered prayers, suffering in the world
- Don't try to "fix" people's doubts—let them name them
- Connect to the father's prayer: "Help my unbelief"</p>
<p><strong>"Where in your life is God asking you to act on faith—to do something that requires trusting him even though you can't see the outcome?"</strong></p>
<p><em>Facilitator notes:</em>
- Encourage specificity: a conversation, a decision, a change, a risk
- What would it look like to take one step of faith this week?</p></div><div class="section"><h2>Devotional Guide</h2><h1 id="session-2-devotional-saying-yes-to-god">Session 2 Devotional: Saying Yes to God</h1>
<p><strong>15 Minutes with Jesus</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Jesus said to him, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'"</em>
— John 14:6 (NABRE)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-leap-that-isnt-blind">The Leap That Isn't Blind</h2>
<p>You have been on a journey. You have learned that God exists, that He answers the problem of evil with love. You have encountered the Trinity, traced God's covenant plan, and met Jesus Christ—the Answer Incarnate. You have discovered the Church, Scripture, Tradition, the Mass, the saints.</p>
<p>You know so much more than when you started. And yet—knowing is not the same as believing.</p>
<p>Faith is not pretending to be certain when you're not. Faith is not checking your brain at the door. Faith is responding to a God who has already reached out to you—a God who reveals Himself through Scripture and Tradition, through the Church, through the sacraments—and waits for your response.</p>
<p><strong>St. John Henry Newman</strong> described his own journey this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Ten thousand difficulties do not make one doubt."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can have questions. You can struggle. You can wrestle. That's not the opposite of faith—that's often how faith grows. What matters is that you keep turning toward the One who created you, who loves you, who is calling you to a life in Him.</p>
<h2 id="faith-built-on-grace">Faith Built on Grace</h2>
<p>In our first session, we reflected on grace—God's free gift of Himself. Now we see that faith is our response to that gift.</p>
<p>Grace comes first. Always. God reveals Himself before we seek Him. God loves us before we love Him. God calls us before we answer.</p>
<p>Faith is simply saying <em>yes</em> to what God has already done.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grace</strong> is God reaching out to us.</li>
<li><strong>Faith</strong> is us reaching back.</li>
<li><strong>Hope</strong> will be trusting where that relationship leads.</li>
<li><strong>Love</strong> will be living fully in that relationship.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without grace, we could not believe. But grace has been given. The question now is: Will you believe?</p>
<p><strong>St. Augustine</strong>, after years of running from God, finally surrendered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Late have I loved you, Beauty so ancient and so new, late have I loved you! You were within me, but I was outside... You called, you shouted, and you broke through my deafness."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God is calling. He is breaking through. Faith is hearing that call and responding.</p>
<h2 id="reflection-questions">Reflection Questions</h2>
<p><em>Sit quietly with Jesus. Let these questions rest in your heart.</em></p>
<p><strong>1. What has God done to reveal Himself to me?</strong></p>
<p>A person? An experience? A longing that won't go away?</p>
<p><em>My thoughts:</em></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<p><strong>2. Where do I struggle to believe?</strong></p>
<p>Can I bring that struggle honestly to Jesus right now?</p>
<p><em>My thoughts:</em></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<p><strong>3. What would it mean for me to say "yes" to God today?</strong></p>
<p>Not a perfect yes. Not a certain yes. Just an honest yes.</p>
<p><em>My thoughts:</em></p>
<hr />
<hr />

<h2 id="a-prayer-for-faith">A Prayer for Faith</h2>
<p><em>Pray this slowly, from your heart:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lord Jesus, I want to believe.</strong></p>
<p>I bring You my doubts, my questions, my uncertainties.
I bring You the parts of me that struggle to trust.
I bring You my whole self—not just the parts that feel ready.</p>
<p>You have revealed Yourself to me in ways I'm only beginning to understand.
Help me to see. Help me to hear. Help me to respond.</p>
<p>I believe, Lord. Help my unbelief.</p>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="traditional-prayer-act-of-faith">Traditional Prayer: Act of Faith</h2>
<p><em>This ancient prayer expresses the heart of what it means to believe. Pray it slowly, making each phrase your own.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>O my God, I firmly believe that you are one God in three divine Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I believe that your divine Son became man and died for our sins, and that he will come to judge the living and the dead.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I believe these and all the truths which the holy Catholic Church teaches, because you have revealed them, who can neither deceive nor be deceived.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>

<h2 id="rest-in-his-presence">Rest in His Presence</h2>
<p><em>Now, set aside this booklet.</em></p>
<p>You have reflected. You have prayed. But the most important thing is simply to <em>be</em> with Jesus.</p>
<p>He is here—truly present in the Blessed Sacrament before you. You don't need to have all the answers. You don't need perfect faith. Just be with the One who is calling you. Speak to Him from your heart—your doubts, your hopes, your desire to believe. Or simply be still and let Him speak to you.</p>

<p><strong>We hope in God's promise of a share in his glory in Heaven. God's promises are trustworthy. Hope offers to us authentic joy and true courage, and sustains us in times of trial.</strong></p>

<h3 id="opening-3-minutes">Opening (3 minutes)</h3>
<p><em>Connect to Sessions 1 &amp; 2:</em> We've talked about grace—God giving us his life. We've talked about faith—saying "yes" to God. Now we come to hope. If faith says "I believe God exists and loves me," hope says "I trust that God will keep his promises."</p>
<p>Ask the group: <em>"What's the difference between hope and wishful thinking?"</em></p>
<p>Hope isn't crossing your fingers. Hope is anchoring your soul to the faithfulness of God.</p>
<p><strong>Hebrews 6:19 (NABRE):</strong> <em>"This we have as an anchor of the soul, sure and firm, which reaches into the interior behind the veil."</em></p>
<p>This is why we call hope an "anchor"—it holds us steady when everything else is shaking.</p>
<h3 id="talking-point-1-hope-is-anchored-in-gods-promises-not-our-circumstances-8-minutes">Talking Point 1: Hope Is Anchored in God's Promises, Not Our Circumstances (8 minutes)</h3>
<p><strong>Primary Scripture: Romans 5:1-5 (NABRE)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith to this grace in which we stand, and we boast in hope of the glory of God. Not only that, but we even boast of our afflictions, knowing that affliction produces endurance, and endurance, proven character, and proven character, hope, and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the holy Spirit that has been given to us."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key points to emphasize:</strong>
- Notice the progression: suffering → endurance → character → hope
- Hope doesn't come <em>despite</em> suffering—it often comes <em>through</em> suffering
- <em>"Hope does not disappoint"</em>—this is a bold claim. Why? Because it's anchored in God's love, not our circumstances.
- The Holy Spirit pours God's love into our hearts—hope is connected to experiencing God's love</p>
<p><strong>CCC 1817:</strong> <em>"Hope is the theological virtue by which we desire the kingdom of heaven and eternal life as our happiness, placing our trust in Christ's promises and relying not on our own strength, but on the help of the grace of the Holy Spirit."</em></p>
<p>Key phrase: <em>"relying not on our own strength."</em> Hope is not optimism about our abilities. It's confidence in God's faithfulness.</p>
<h3 id="talking-point-2-hope-gives-us-a-reason-to-live-differently-8-minutes">Talking Point 2: Hope Gives Us a Reason to Live Differently (8 minutes)</h3>
<p><strong>Primary Scripture: Jeremiah 29:11-13 (NABRE)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"For I know well the plans I have in mind for you—oracle of the LORD—plans for your welfare and not for woe, so as to give you a future of hope. When you call me, and come and pray to me, I will listen to you. When you look for me, you will find me. Yes, when you seek me with all your heart."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key points to emphasize:</strong>
- God spoke these words to Israel <em>in exile</em>—when everything seemed lost
- Hope is not denial of present suffering; it's confidence in future redemption
- <em>"Plans for welfare and not for evil"</em>—God is for us, not against us
- <em>"You will seek me and find me"</em>—hope leads to seeking, and seeking leads to finding
- Hope reorders our priorities: If Heaven is real, then this life is preparation, not the main event</p>
<p><strong>What hope does:</strong>
- Puts our problems in perspective—they're real, but they're not the end of the story
- Gives us courage to face difficulty—we know how the story ends
- Frees us from despair—even when things look hopeless, God is working
- Motivates holiness—if Heaven is our destination, we want to be ready</p>
<h3 id="talking-point-3-the-enemies-of-hope-8-minutes">Talking Point 3: The Enemies of Hope (8 minutes)</h3>
<p><strong>Primary Scripture: Romans 8:24-25, 28 (NABRE)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"For in hope we were saved. Now hope that sees for itself is not hope. For who hopes for what one sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait with endurance... We know that all things work for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key points to emphasize:</strong>
- Hope requires patience—we don't see the fulfillment yet
- <em>"In everything God works for good"</em>—not "everything is good," but God works in everything</p>
<p><strong>Two sins against hope:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Despair</strong> — Giving up on God's promises
- Believing your sins are too great to be forgiven
- Believing your situation is beyond God's help
- Believing that Heaven isn't real or isn't for you
- Despair says: "God can't" or "God won't"</p>
<p><strong>2. Presumption</strong> — Taking God's promises for granted
- Assuming you'll be saved without conversion
- Expecting forgiveness without repentance
- Living however you want because "God is merciful"
- Presumption says: "God must" or "God owes me"</p>
<p><strong>CCC 2091:</strong> <em>"Despair... is contrary to God's goodness, to his justice—for the Lord is faithful to his promises—and to his mercy."</em></p>
<p>Hope walks the middle path: trusting God's mercy while taking his justice seriously.</p>
<h3 id="closing-3-minutes">Closing (3 minutes)</h3>
<p>Hope is what gets us through. When the diagnosis is bad, when the relationship is broken, when the future is uncertain—hope says, "God is faithful. He keeps his promises. This is not the end."</p>
<p>By faith, we believe. In hope, we trust. And hope prepares us for love—because when we're confident in God's love for us, we're freed to love others.</p>
<p><strong>1 Thessalonians 5:8 (NABRE):</strong> <em>"But since we are of the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love and the helmet that is hope for salvation."</em></p>
<p>Hope is our helmet—it protects our minds from despair and presumption. It guards our thinking so we can live as children of the light.</p>
<p>Now we're going to send you to spend time with Jesus in the Sanctuary. As you sit before him in the Blessed Sacrament, bring to him whatever is stirring in your heart about hope—your fears, your disappointments, your longing for something more. Just be with him.</p>
<p><strong>Let us pray</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Jesus, you are our hope—the anchor of our souls. We have heard your promises, and we know that you are faithful. Now send us into your presence. As we sit before you in the Blessed Sacrament, anchor our hearts in you. Where we are tempted to despair, give us confidence. Where we are tempted to presume, give us holy reverence. We go now to rest in the One who keeps his promises. In your holy name we pray. Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Please proceed quietly to the Sanctuary.</em></p>

<h3 id="the-beatitudes-jesus-roadmap-of-hope-matthew-53-12">The Beatitudes: Jesus' Roadmap of Hope (Matthew 5:3-12)</h3>
<p>Jesus gave us the Beatitudes to show us what a hope-filled life looks like. Each beatitude is a promise: "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for <em>theirs is the kingdom of heaven</em>." Hope isn't passive—it shapes how we live <em>now</em> because we know where we're going.</p>
<h3 id="purgatory-a-sign-of-hope">Purgatory: A Sign of Hope</h3>
<p>Here's something beautiful: Purgatory gives us hope. Why? Because it shows us how much God wants us to be with him in Heaven. Purgatory isn't punishment—it's purification. It means that even if we die imperfect (and we all will), God has made a way for us to be made ready for Heaven. That's hope.</p>
<h3 id="hope-fosters-prayer-ccc-2657">Hope Fosters Prayer (CCC 2657)</h3>
<p>Hope and prayer go together. When we hope, we pray. When we pray, our hope grows. The Psalms are filled with hope: <em>"For God alone my soul waits in silence; from him comes my salvation"</em> (Ps 62:1). The Mass, the Liturgy of the Hours, personal prayer—all of these nourish hope in us.</p></div><div class="section"><h2>Group Discussion</h2><h1 id="session-3-hope-group-discussion-20-minutes">Session 3: Hope - Group Discussion (20 minutes)</h1>
<p><em>Participants return from the Sanctuary to share what God revealed to them during their time with Jesus.</em></p>
<h2 id="opening-question-what-is-god-showing-you-10-minutes">Opening Question: What Is God Showing You? (10 minutes)</h2>
<p><strong>"How is God helping you grow in hope today? What revelations or insights did you receive during your time with Jesus?"</strong></p>
<p><em>Facilitator notes:</em>
- This is the primary question—give it space and time
- Let participants share freely what they experienced in prayer
- Some may have confronted fears; others may have felt peace
- All responses are valid—God works differently in each person
- Listen for themes that emerge across the group</p>
<h2 id="follow-up-questions-if-needed-10-minutes">Follow-Up Questions (if needed, 10 minutes)</h2>
<p><em>Use these only if the conversation needs prompting:</em></p>
<p><strong>"Think of a time when you felt hopeless—when circumstances seemed impossible. What happened to your relationship with God during that time? Did you draw closer or pull away?"</strong></p>
<p><em>Facilitator notes:</em>
- This question invites vulnerability about dark times
- Don't rush to "fix" or offer platitudes—let people sit with the reality
- Connect to Romans 5: suffering can produce hope, but it's a process</p>
<p><strong>"What is one concrete way you could practice hope this week? What would it look like to anchor your soul more firmly in God's promises?"</strong></p>
<p><em>Facilitator notes:</em>
- Possible answers: praying when anxious instead of worrying, meditating on Scripture promises, trusting God with a specific situation
- This prepares them for the final session on love—hope frees us to love</p></div><div class="section"><h2>Devotional Guide</h2><h1 id="session-3-devotional-anchored-in-hope">Session 3 Devotional: Anchored in Hope</h1>
<p><strong>15 Minutes with Jesus</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the holy Spirit that has been given to us."</em>
— Romans 5:5 (NABRE)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-anchor-that-holds">The Anchor That Holds</h2>
<p>Life is hard. You know this.</p>
<p>You have learned that God exists—and that evil and suffering are real. You have seen how God's answer to suffering is love: truth, justice, and mercy woven together. You have traced His covenant faithfulness through history, even when His people failed Him again and again.</p>
<p>God does not abandon. God keeps His promises. This is the foundation of hope.</p>
<p>And yet—there are days when the weight feels unbearable. Anxiety about the future. Grief over the past. Discouragement in the present. The state of the world. The struggles in your own life. Moments when you wonder if things will ever change.</p>
<p>And yet—you are here. You have not given up. Something in you keeps reaching for the light.</p>
<p>That something is hope.</p>
<p>Hope is not optimism. Optimism says, "Things will probably work out." Hope says, "God is faithful, no matter what happens." Optimism depends on circumstances. Hope depends on God.</p>
<p>Jesus said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give it to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled or afraid."</em> (John 14:27, NABRE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>St. Padre Pio</strong> wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Pray, hope, and don't worry. Worry is useless. God is merciful and will hear your prayer."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>St. Thomas Aquinas</strong> defined hope this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Hope is the theological virtue by which we desire the kingdom of heaven and eternal life as our happiness, placing our trust in Christ's promises and relying not on our own strength, but on the help of the grace of the Holy Spirit."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice: hope relies <em>not on our own strength</em>. This is crucial. Hope is not about being strong enough to endure. Hope is about trusting a God who is strong enough to carry us.</p>
<h2 id="hope-built-on-grace-and-faith">Hope Built on Grace and Faith</h2>
<p>We have journeyed through grace—God's free gift of Himself. We have said yes in faith—believing that God is who He says He is. Now hope takes us further.</p>
<p>Hope is faith looking forward.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grace</strong> is God giving Himself to us.</li>
<li><strong>Faith</strong> is believing that gift is real.</li>
<li><strong>Hope</strong> is trusting that God will complete what He has begun.</li>
<li><strong>Love</strong> will be living fully in that completion.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>St. Paul</strong> understood this progression when he wrote to the Philippians:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I am confident of this, that the one who began a good work in you will continue to complete it until the day of Christ Jesus."</em> (Philippians 1:6, NABRE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God has begun something in you. Hope trusts that He will finish it.</p>
<h2 id="reflection-questions">Reflection Questions</h2>
<p><em>Sit quietly with Jesus. Let these questions rest in your heart.</em></p>
<p><strong>1. Where in my life am I tempted to despair or discouragement?</strong></p>
<p>Can I bring that place to Jesus right now and ask for hope?</p>
<p><em>My thoughts:</em></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<p><strong>2. What am I trying to carry that I need to surrender to God?</strong></p>
<p>Anxiety? Grief? Fear? The need to control?</p>
<p><em>My thoughts:</em></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<p><strong>3. How would my life be different if I truly believed God's promises?</strong></p>
<p>What would I do? What would I stop doing? How would I face tomorrow?</p>
<p><em>My thoughts:</em></p>
<hr />
<hr />

<h2 id="a-prayer-for-hope">A Prayer for Hope</h2>
<p><em>Pray this slowly, from your heart:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lord Jesus, I am tired.</strong></p>
<p>I am tired of struggling. Tired of waiting. Tired of wondering if things will ever change.</p>
<p>But I come to You because I believe You are faithful.
I come to You because Your promises are true.
I come to You because You are my only hope.</p>
<p>Anchor my soul in You.
When the storms come, hold me fast.
When the darkness closes in, be my light.
When I am tempted to give up, remind me that You never give up on me.</p>
<p>I place my hope in You alone.</p>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="traditional-prayer-act-of-hope">Traditional Prayer: Act of Hope</h2>
<p><em>This ancient prayer expresses confident trust in God's promises. Pray it slowly, letting each phrase strengthen your heart.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>O my God, relying on your infinite goodness and promises, I hope to obtain pardon of my sins, the help of your grace, and life everlasting, through the merits of Jesus Christ, my Lord and Redeemer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="rest-in-his-presence">Rest in His Presence</h2>
<p><em>Now, set aside this booklet.</em></p>
<p>You have reflected. You have prayed. But the most important thing is simply to <em>be</em> with Jesus.</p>
<p>He is here—truly present in the Blessed Sacrament before you. You don't need to solve your problems right now. You don't need to feel hopeful. Just rest in the presence of the One who holds your future. Speak to Him from your heart—your fears, your weariness, your longing for something more. Or simply be still and let His peace wash over you.</p>
<p><strong>Remain here in silence until the bell rings.</strong></p>
<p>When you hear the bell, pray the closing prayer below, then return quietly to the Parish Hall.</p>
<h2 id="closing-prayer-the-anima-christi">Closing Prayer: The Anima Christi</h2>
<p><em>Ask Christ to anchor your hope as you pray:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Soul of Christ, sanctify me.</strong>
Body of Christ, save me.
Blood of Christ, inebriate me.
Water from the side of Christ, wash me.
Passion of Christ, strengthen me.
O good Jesus, hear me.
Within your wounds, hide me.
Permit me not to be separated from you.
From the wicked foe, defend me.
At the hour of my death, call me
and bid me come to you,
that with your saints I may praise you
forever and ever.
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>We do not walk this journey alone. The saints who have gone before us intercede for us. Ask for their prayers:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Holy Mary, Mother of Hope, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
<p>St. John Paul II, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
<p>St. Padre Pio, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
<p>St. Thomas Aquinas, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
<p>All holy men and women, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="as-you-leave">As You Leave</h2>
<p><em>While making the Sign of the Cross, pray:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lord, I place my hope in You.</strong>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are not alone. You have never been alone. The God who began a good work in you will be faithful to complete it.</p>
<p>Go in peace. The journey continues.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-teaching-30-minutes">Part 1: Teaching (30 minutes)</h2>
<h3 id="central-truth">Central Truth</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Love is the essence of the inner life of the Trinity. It is the soul of holiness and the basis upon which we will be judged. In Heaven, the faithful will live in the joy of perfect love.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="opening-3-minutes">Opening (3 minutes)</h3>
<p><em>Connect to the entire retreat:</em> Everything we've talked about today leads here. Grace is God giving us his life. Faith is saying "yes" to God. Hope is trusting his promises. But love—love is the destination. Love is why God created us. Love is what we were made for.</p>
<p>Ask the group: <em>"What must I do to inherit eternal life?"</em></p>
<p>That's the question a lawyer asked Jesus in Luke 10. And Jesus' answer was: Love. Love God. Love your neighbor. <em>"Do this, and you will live."</em></p>
<h3 id="talking-point-1-god-is-lovenot-just-that-he-loves-8-minutes">Talking Point 1: God IS Love—Not Just That He Loves (8 minutes)</h3>
<p><strong>Primary Scripture: 1 John 4:7-12, 16 (NABRE)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God; everyone who loves is begotten by God and knows God. Whoever is without love does not know God, for God is love. In this way the love of God was revealed to us: God sent his only Son into the world so that we might have life through him. In this is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as expiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also must love one another. No one has ever seen God. Yet, if we love one another, God remains in us, and his love is brought to perfection in us... God is love, and whoever remains in love remains in God and God in him."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key points to emphasize:</strong>
- <em>"God IS love"</em>—not just that God loves, but that love is his very nature
- The Trinity is an eternal communion of love: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit giving themselves to each other
- We were created to participate in this love—to receive it and to give it
- <em>"He who does not love does not know God"</em>—you cannot know God without loving
- Love is not optional for Christians—it's the very definition of what it means to follow Christ</p>
<p><strong>CCC 1822:</strong> <em>"Charity is the theological virtue by which we love God above all things for his own sake, and our neighbor as ourselves for the love of God."</em></p>
<p>Notice: We love God <em>for his own sake</em>—not for what we get from him. And we love neighbor <em>for the love of God</em>—not because they deserve it.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> The theological virtues—including love—are <em>infused</em> by God at Baptism (CCC 1266). We don't earn them; we receive them as gift. They adapt us for participation in God's own nature (CCC 1812). This is why love is not just a nice feeling—it's a supernatural gift that enables us to love as God loves.</p>
<h3 id="talking-point-2-love-is-a-commandwhich-means-its-a-choice-8-minutes">Talking Point 2: Love Is a Command—Which Means It's a Choice (8 minutes)</h3>
<p><strong>Primary Scripture: John 13:34-35; 15:12-13 (NABRE)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I give you a new commandment: love one another. As I have loved you, so you also should love one another. This is how all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."</em></p>
<p><em>"This is my commandment: love one another as I love you. No one has greater love than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key points to emphasize:</strong>
- Jesus <em>commands</em> us to love—which means love is an act of the will, not just a feeling
- <em>"As I have loved you"</em>—the standard is Christ's love, not human affection
- How did Jesus love? Sacrificially. Unconditionally. To the point of death.
- <em>"By this all men will know"</em>—love is the mark of a Christian, the proof of our faith
- Love is not "something to do"—it is the point of all doing</p>
<p><strong>What love is NOT:</strong>
- Love is not a feeling (though feelings may accompany it)
- Love is not approval of everything someone does
- Love is not being "nice" or avoiding conflict
- Love is not earned or deserved</p>
<p><strong>What love IS:</strong>
- Willing the good of the other
- Self-gift—giving yourself for the sake of another
- An act of the will that can be commanded and chosen
- The fulfillment of the entire law (Romans 13:10)
- The bond of perfect harmony that holds all virtues together (Colossians 3:14)</p>
<p><strong>Supporting Scripture: Galatians 5:6 (NABRE)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Faith and love cannot be separated. A faith that does not express itself in love is not saving faith. As James writes: <em>"Faith of itself, if it does not have works, is dead"</em> (James 2:17).</p>
<p><strong>Why can't faith be separated from love?</strong> Because faith, hope, and all the virtues are all part of the supernatural gift of LOVE!</p>
<p>Think about it this way:
- <strong>Love is the "form" of all the virtues</strong> (CCC 1827)—it gives them their shape and direction
- <strong>Faith</strong> believes in God—but <em>why</em> do we believe? Because we love the One who reveals himself
- <strong>Hope</strong> trusts God's promises—but <em>why</em> do we trust? Because we love the One who promises
- <strong>Every virtue</strong> is ordered toward love—justice, mercy, patience, kindness—all of them flow from and lead back to love</p>
<p>St. Paul says love is <em>"the bond of perfection"</em> (Colossians 3:14)—it's the glue that holds all the virtues together. Without love, the other virtues fall apart. With love, they become a unified whole.</p>
<p>This is why the Church teaches that <strong>charity is the soul of holiness</strong> (CCC 826). You can have faith and hope without charity (as in mortal sin), but they cannot save you—they're like a body without a soul. Love is what animates everything else.</p>
<p>So when we talk about growing in faith, hope, or any virtue—we're really talking about growing in love. It's all one gift, and that gift is participation in God's own life—because <em>God IS love</em>.</p>
<h3 id="talking-point-3-the-final-testlove-in-action-8-minutes">Talking Point 3: The Final Test—Love in Action (8 minutes)</h3>
<p><strong>Primary Scripture: Matthew 25:31-40 (NABRE)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit upon his glorious throne, and all the nations will be assembled before him. And he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. Then the king will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, a stranger and you welcomed me, naked and you clothed me, ill and you cared for me, in prison and you visited me.' Then the righteous will answer him and say, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? When did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? When did we see you ill or in prison, and visit you?' And the king will say to them in reply, 'Amen, I say to you, whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me.'"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key points to emphasize:</strong>
- This is the "final test"—the basis on which we will be judged
- Notice: Jesus doesn't ask about our theology or our feelings. He asks about our actions.
- <em>"As you did it to one of the least of these, you did it to me"</em>—Jesus identifies with the poor, the suffering, the forgotten
- Love must be concrete—it must take action
- Faith and hope prepare us for love; love is the destination</p>
<p><strong>CCC 1826:</strong> <em>"If I... have not charity, I am nothing... Charity is superior to all the virtues. It is the first of the theological virtues."</em></p>
<p><strong>The sins against love (CCC 2093-2094):</strong>
- <strong>Indifference</strong>—not caring about God's love or the needs of others
- <strong>Ingratitude</strong>—taking God's love for granted, failing to give thanks
- <strong>Lukewarmness</strong>—half-hearted response to God's love
- <strong>Acedia</strong> (spiritual sloth)—refusing to engage with God's love; spiritual laziness
- <strong>Hatred</strong>—the direct opposite of love, wishing evil upon God or neighbor</p>
<p><strong>How sin affects love:</strong>
- <strong>Mortal sin</strong> destroys charity in the heart—it kills love, even when faith and hope remain
- <strong>Venial sin</strong> wounds charity—it weakens our love but does not destroy it
- This is why we need the Sacrament of Reconciliation—to restore and heal our capacity to love</p>
<h3 id="closing-3-minutes">Closing (3 minutes)</h3>
<p>Here's the truth we've been building toward all day:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grace</strong> is God giving us his life—so that we can love</li>
<li><strong>Faith</strong> is saying "yes" to God—so that we can receive his love</li>
<li><strong>Hope</strong> is trusting God's promises—so that we're freed to love without fear</li>
<li><strong>Love</strong> is the destination—participating in the very life of the Trinity</li>
</ul>
<p>The question isn't "Do you feel loving?" The question is "Will you choose to love?"</p>
<p>Jesus said: <em>"By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."</em></p>
<p>Not by your knowledge. Not by your attendance. Not by your feelings. By your love.</p>
<p>Now we're going to send you to spend time with Jesus in the Sanctuary. As you sit before him in the Blessed Sacrament—Love Incarnate—bring to him whatever is stirring in your heart. Ask him to help you receive his love and to love as he loves. Just be with him.</p>
<p><strong>Let us pray</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Jesus, you are Love Incarnate—God who IS love, made visible in human flesh. We have heard your command to love as you have loved us. Now send us into your presence. As we sit before you in the Blessed Sacrament, help us first to receive your love, so that we may have love to give. Soften our hearts toward those we find hard to love. Set us on fire with the love that casts out fear. We go now to be with the One who loved us to the end. In your holy name we pray. Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Please proceed quietly to the Sanctuary.</em></p>

<h3 id="love-and-the-sacraments">Love and the Sacraments</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Eucharist</strong> is the "Sacrament of Love"—Jesus stays with us because of love</li>
<li><strong>Confession</strong> restores our broken fellowship with the Father when sin has wounded or destroyed love</li>
<li>Through the sacraments, God's love is poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit (Romans 5:5)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="love-and-prayer-ccc-2658">Love and Prayer (CCC 2658)</h3>
<p>Love is both the <em>source</em> of prayer and the <em>heights</em> of prayer. We pray because we love God. And the more we pray, the more we grow in love. Prayer and love feed each other.</p>
<h3 id="love-and-justice-ccc-1889">Love and Justice (CCC 1889)</h3>
<p>It is charity that enables us to act justly. Without love, we cannot give others what they are owed. Love is not opposed to justice—love <em>enables</em> justice.</p></div><div class="section"><h2>Group Discussion</h2><h1 id="session-4-love-group-discussion-20-minutes">Session 4: Love - Group Discussion (20 minutes)</h1>
<p><em>Participants return from the Sanctuary to share what God revealed to them during their time with Jesus.</em></p>
<h2 id="opening-question-what-is-god-showing-you-10-minutes">Opening Question: What Is God Showing You? (10 minutes)</h2>
<p><strong>"How is God helping you grow in love today? What revelations or insights did you receive during your time with Jesus?"</strong></p>
<p><em>Facilitator notes:</em>
- This is the primary question—give it space and time
- Let participants share freely what they experienced in prayer
- Some may have felt God's love deeply; others may have been challenged
- All responses are valid—God works differently in each person
- Listen for themes that emerge across the group</p>
<h2 id="follow-up-questions-if-needed-10-minutes">Follow-Up Questions (if needed, 10 minutes)</h2>
<p><em>Use these only if the conversation needs prompting:</em></p>
<p><strong>"Do you actually believe God loves you? Not in theory, but personally—do you believe God delights in you, wants you, pursues you? What makes it hard to receive that love?"</strong></p>
<p><em>Facilitator notes:</em>
- This is foundational—we cannot give what we haven't received
- Common obstacles: shame, past failures, feeling unworthy
- Connect to 1 John 4:19: "We love because he first loved us"</p>
<p><strong>"Based on everything you've heard today, what is one specific way you will choose to love this week—either in receiving God's love more deeply, or in giving love to someone who needs it?"</strong></p>
<p><em>Facilitator notes:</em>
- This is the decision point of the entire retreat
- Encourage specificity: not "I'll try to be more loving" but "I will call my estranged brother" or "I will spend 10 minutes in prayer each morning receiving God's love"
- This prepares them for the closing session and their return to daily life</p></div><div class="section"><h2>Devotional Guide</h2><h1 id="session-4-devotional-abiding-in-love">Session 4 Devotional: Abiding in Love</h1>

<p><em>"God is love, and whoever remains in love remains in God and God in him."</em>
— 1 John 4:16 (NABRE)</p>

<h2 id="the-destination-of-the-journey">The Destination of the Journey</h2>
<p>You have traveled far—not just today, but throughout your entire OCIA journey.</p>
<p>You learned that God exists and that the solution to evil and suffering is love. You discovered that love is not a feeling but a reality that binds truth, justice, and mercy together. You met the Trinity—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—an eternal communion of love. You traced God's covenant plan, saw it fulfilled in Jesus Christ, and found it alive in the Church, the Mass, the sacraments.</p>
<p>Everything you have learned has been pointing here. To love.</p>
<p>Today you began with grace—the overwhelming gift of God pouring out His very life toward you. You responded with faith—saying yes to a God who reveals Himself. You anchored yourself in hope—trusting that God will complete what He has begun.</p>
<p>Now you arrive at the destination: Love.</p>
<p>But here is the beautiful truth—love is not just the destination. Love has been with you all along. Grace <em>is</em> love reaching out. Faith <em>is</em> love received. Hope <em>is</em> love trusted. And now, love calls you to <em>remain</em>.</p>
<p><strong>St. John</strong> understood this when he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"In this is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as expiation for our sins."</em> (1 John 4:10, NABRE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Love begins with God. Always. You are not here to earn God's love. You are here to receive it, to rest in it, and to let it transform you.</p>
<h2 id="god-is-love">God IS Love</h2>
<p>St. Paul wrote that faith, hope, and love abide—but <em>the greatest of these is love</em> (1 Corinthians 13:13).</p>
<p>Why is love the greatest?</p>
<p>Because love is who God <em>is</em>. Not just what God does—who God <em>is</em>. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are an eternal communion of self-giving love. And this love—this very love—has been pursuing you your entire life. Before you knew His name. Before you walked through the doors of this parish. Before you took your first breath. God's love was there.</p>
<p><strong>St. Augustine</strong> captured this beautifully:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The restlessness you have felt—the longing, the searching, the ache for something more—that is your heart seeking the love it was made for. And that love is here. That love is now. That love is Jesus, present before you.</p>
<h2 id="called-to-be-love-in-the-world">Called to Be Love in the World</h2>
<p>But God does not call you simply to receive His love. He calls you to <em>become</em> His love in the world.</p>
<p>The prophet Micah asked what the Lord requires of us. The answer echoes through the ages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"You have been told, O mortal, what is good, and what the LORD requires of you: Only to do justice and to love goodness, and to walk humbly with your God."</em> (Micah 6:8, NABRE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is your calling. This is why you are here. Not just to know about God's love, but to <em>be</em> God's love—to bear truth in a world drowning in lies, to do justice where injustice reigns, to love mercy when the world demands vengeance, and to walk humbly with your God every step of the way.</p>
<p>Jesus gave everything for you. Now He invites you to give your whole life to Him.</p>
<p><strong>St. John of the Cross</strong> wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"In the evening of life, we will be judged on love alone."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not on how much we knew. Not on how much we accomplished. Not on how impressive our faith appeared. On love. Only love.</p>
<h2 id="the-next-generation">The Next Generation</h2>
<p>Look around you. The world is dark. But you—<em>you</em>—are called to be light.</p>
<p>Jesus said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"You are the light of the world. A city set on a mountain cannot be hidden."</em> (Matthew 5:14, NABRE)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are the next generation that brings light into the darkness. You are the ones who will carry the faith forward. You are the hands and feet of Christ in a world that desperately needs to see His love made visible.</p>
<p>This is not a burden. This is a gift. This is the adventure you were made for.</p>
<h2 id="reflection-questions">Reflection Questions</h2>
<p><em>Sit quietly with Jesus. Let these questions rest in your heart.</em></p>
<p><strong>1. Do I truly believe that God—who IS love—has been pursuing me my whole life?</strong></p>
<p>How does this change the way I see my past, my present, my future?</p>
<p><em>My thoughts:</em></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<p><strong>2. Am I willing to give my whole life to Christ, as He gave His life for me?</strong></p>
<p>What am I still holding back? What would it look like to surrender completely?</p>
<p><em>My thoughts:</em></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<p><strong>3. How is God calling me to be His love in the world?</strong></p>
<p>To bear truth? To do justice? To love mercy? To walk humbly? Where is He sending me?</p>
<p><em>My thoughts:</em></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<p><strong>4. Will I accept the call to be light in the darkness?</strong></p>
<p>The world needs what you have received. Will you share it?</p>
<p><em>My thoughts:</em></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<h2 id="a-prayer-of-total-surrender">A Prayer of Total Surrender</h2>
<p><em>Pray this slowly, from your heart:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lord Jesus, You are Love.</strong></p>
<p>You loved me before I knew You.
You loved me when I ran from You.
You love me now, in all my weakness and failure.</p>
<p>I give You my whole life.
Not part of it. Not the easy parts. All of it.
As You gave Yourself completely for me, I give myself completely to You.</p>
<p>Make me Your love in the world.
Send me to bear truth where there are lies.
Send me to do justice where there is oppression.
Send me to love mercy where there is cruelty.
Teach me to walk humbly with You every day.</p>
<p>I am Yours. Use me. Send me. I am ready.</p>
<p><em>"You have been told, O mortal, what is good, and what the LORD requires of you: Only to do justice and to love goodness, and to walk humbly with your God."</em> (Micah 6:8)</p>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="traditional-prayer-act-of-love">Traditional Prayer: Act of Love</h2>
<p><em>This ancient prayer expresses the heart of charity—loving God above all and neighbor for God's sake. Pray it slowly, letting each phrase become your own.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>O my God, I love you above all things, with my whole heart and soul, because you are all good and worthy of all my love.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I love my neighbor as myself for the love of you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I forgive all who have injured me, and I ask pardon of all whom I have injured.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="rest-in-his-presence">Rest in His Presence</h2>
<p><em>Now, set aside this booklet.</em></p>
<p>You have reflected. You have prayed. But the most important thing is simply to <em>be</em> with Jesus—Love Himself.</p>
<p>He is here—truly present in the Blessed Sacrament before you. You don't need to do anything. You don't need to prove anything. Just rest in the arms of the Jesus who loves you more than you can imagine. Speak to Him from your heart—your gratitude, your surrender, your desire to love as He loves. Or simply be still and receive His love.</p>
<p><strong>Remain here in silence until the bell rings.</strong></p>
<p>When you hear the bell, pray the closing prayer below, then return quietly to the Parish Hall.</p>
<h2 id="closing-prayer-the-anima-christi">Closing Prayer: The Anima Christi</h2>
<p><em>Ask Christ to fill you with His love as you pray:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Soul of Christ, sanctify me.</strong>
Body of Christ, save me.
Blood of Christ, inebriate me.
Water from the side of Christ, wash me.
Passion of Christ, strengthen me.
O good Jesus, hear me.
Within your wounds, hide me.
Permit me not to be separated from you.
From the wicked foe, defend me.
At the hour of my death, call me
and bid me come to you,
that with your saints I may praise you
forever and ever.
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>We do not walk this journey alone. The saints who have gone before us intercede for us. Ask for their prayers:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Holy Mary, Queen of Heaven, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
<p>St. John Paul II, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
<p>St. Augustine, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
<p>St. John of the Cross, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>
<p>All holy men and women, <strong>pray for us.</strong></p>

<strong>Amen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have received grace. You have said yes in faith. You have anchored yourself in hope. Now go and love—for love is why you were made.</p>
<p>Go in peace. The journey continues—and love leads the way.</p>
