# Session 2: Faith - Teaching Notes

## Key Points to Emphasize

1. **Faith is a response to God's revelation** - God speaks first, we respond
2. **Faith is both gift and choice** - God gives the grace, we say yes
3. **Faith grows through practice** - Like a muscle, it strengthens with use

## Common Questions

**Q: What if I have doubts?**
A: Doubts are normal. Bring them to God. Faith is not the absence of questions but trust despite them.

**Q: How is Catholic faith different from just believing in God?**
A: Catholic faith includes trust in what God has revealed through Scripture and Tradition, and in the Church He established.

## Transition to Prayer Time

Invite participants to ask Jesus: "Lord, increase my faith. Help me to trust you more."

## Discussion Starter

"What struck you most during your time with Jesus? What insight or feeling did you experience?"
