# Session 1: Grace - Teaching Notes

## Key Points to Emphasize

1. **Grace is a gift, not a reward** - We cannot earn God's love
2. **Grace transforms us** - It's not just forgiveness, but new life
3. **Grace comes through the sacraments** - Especially Baptism and Eucharist

## Common Questions

**Q: If grace is free, why do we need to do anything?**
A: Grace empowers us to respond. Our cooperation is itself a gift of grace.

**Q: How do I know if I have grace?**
A: The desire for God is itself a sign of grace at work.

## Transition to Prayer Time

Invite participants to simply sit with Jesus and receive. No agenda, no performance - just presence.

## Discussion Starter
