# Session 4: Love - Teaching Notes

## Key Points to Emphasize

1. **God IS love** - Love is not just what God does, it's who He is
2. **We love because He first loved us** - Our love is always a response
3. **Love integrates truth, justice, mercy, and sacrifice** - It's not sentimental

## Common Questions

**Q: How can I love people I don't like?**
A: Love is not a feeling but a choice to will the good of another. Feelings may follow, but they're not required.

**Q: What's the difference between loving God and loving neighbor?**
A: They're inseparable. "Whoever does not love a brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen" (1 John 4:20).

## Transition to Prayer Time

Invite participants to let Jesus love them. Don't try to do anything - just receive His gaze.

## Discussion Starter

"What struck you most during your time with Jesus? What insight or feeling did you experience?"
