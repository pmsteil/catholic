## Blessed Sacrament Exposition

The Blessed Sacrament will be exposed in the Sanctuary from approximately 9:50 AM until the closing of the retreat. This means:

### Option A: Exposition All Day (9:50 AM - 4:30 PM)
- Blessed Sacrament exposed after Mass until Benediction
- Every prayer break is time with Jesus truly present
- Requires rotating adorer during Parish Hall sessions

### Option B: Exposition During Closing Hour Only (3:30 - 4:30 PM)
- Exposition begins at start of closing session
- Prayer breaks still valuable (prayer before tabernacle)
- Benediction concludes the retreat

Either option maintains the rhythm of teaching → discussion → prayer, with the Sanctuary as the heart of the retreat.

---

## Facilitator Notes

- Ensure smooth transitions between Parish Hall and Sanctuary
- Have someone remain with the Blessed Sacrament at all times during exposition
- Ring a gentle bell or chime to signal end of prayer times
- Keep teaching times to 30 minutes to allow adequate discussion and prayer time
- The closing session in the Sanctuary will include Benediction
- If using Option A (all-day exposition): Assign a rotating adorer from leadership team during Parish Hall sessions
