## Location Notes

### Parish Hall
- Teaching sessions
- Group discussions
- Lunch
- Welcome and breaks

### Sanctuary
- Rosary (8:30 AM)
- Mass (9:00 AM)
- Blessed Sacrament exposed after Mass (~9:50 AM onwards)
- Prayer with Jesus (25 min after each teaching)
- Closing session (3:30-4:30 PM)


## Blessed Sacrament Exposition

The Blessed Sacrament will be exposed in the Sanctuary from approximately 9:50 AM until the closing of the retreat. This means:

### Option A: Exposition All Day (9:50 AM - 4:30 PM)
- Blessed Sacrament exposed after Mass until Benediction
- Every prayer break is time with Jesus truly present
- Requires rotating adorer during Parish Hall sessions

### Option B: Exposition During Closing Hour Only (3:30 - 4:30 PM)
- Exposition begins at start of closing session
- Prayer breaks still valuable (prayer before tabernacle)
- Benediction concludes the retreat

Either option maintains the rhythm of teaching → prayer → discussion, with the Sanctuary as the heart of the retreat.


## Facilitator Notes

- Ensure smooth transitions between Parish Hall and Sanctuary
- Have someone remain with the Blessed Sacrament at all times during exposition
- Ring a gentle bell or chime to signal end of prayer times (25 minutes)
- Keep teaching times to 30 minutes to allow adequate prayer and discussion time
- **Session Flow:** Teaching (30 min) → Prayer with Jesus (25 min) → Group Discussion (20 min)
- **Discussion Format:** Always begin with the open question about insights from prayer time; use backup questions only if needed
- The closing session in the Sanctuary will include Benediction
- If using Option A (all-day exposition): Assign a rotating adorer from leadership team during Parish Hall sessions
