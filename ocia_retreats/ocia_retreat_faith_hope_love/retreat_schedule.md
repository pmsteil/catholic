## Facilitator Notes

- Ensure smooth transitions between Parish Hall and Sanctuary
- Have someone remain with the Blessed Sacrament at all times during exposition
- Ring a gentle bell or chime to signal end of prayer time about 5 minutes before the end of the prayer time
- Keep teaching times to 30 minutes to allow adequate prayer and discussion time
- **Session Flow:** Teaching (30 min) → Prayer with Jesus (25 min) → Group Discussion (20 min)
- **Discussion Format:** Always begin with the open question about insights from prayer time; use backup questions only if needed
- The Benediction will include the closing prayer
