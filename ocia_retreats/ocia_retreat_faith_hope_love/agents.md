## Faith, Hope, and Love

---

## Project Overview

This project develops a comprehensive OCIA/RCIA retreat focused on **Grace and the Theological Virtues of Faith, Hope, and Love**. The retreat will be held at **JP2 Parish**, utilizing both the **Parish Hall** (for teaching and group activities) and the **Sanctuary** (for prayer and liturgical experiences).

## Participant Context: Catechumens in the Catechumenate

**Stage:** Catechumenate (post-Pre-Evangelization)

These participants have completed the inquiry/pre-evangelization phase and are now catechumens actively learning the faith. They have already received instruction on the following topics, which this retreat builds upon:

### Prior OCIA Lessons (Foundation Already Laid)

1. **The Existence of God & the Problem of Evil and Suffering**
2. **The Solution is Love: Unpacking Truth, Justice & Mercy**
3. **Our Foundation: Dignity of the Human Person**
4. **Who is the Answer? The Blessed Trinity**
5. **The Answer Unfolds: God's Covenant Plan**
6. **The Answer Incarnate: Jesus Christ**
7. **The Answer Lives On: The Church & 4 Marks of the Church**
8. **A Trustworthy Answer: Revelation, Scripture & Tradition**
9. **The Heart of the Answer: The Mass and Church Tour**
10. **Our Family in the Answer: Mary and The Communion of Saints**
11. **The Sacramental Economy**

### What This Means for the Retreat

Participants already understand:
- God exists and is the answer to suffering
- Love (integrating truth, justice, mercy) is God's solution
- The Trinity as communion of love
- God's covenant plan culminating in Christ
- The Church as Christ's continuing presence
- Scripture and Tradition as trustworthy revelation
- The Mass as the heart of Catholic life
- Mary and the saints as our spiritual family
- The sacraments as channels of grace

**This retreat deepens their understanding** by focusing on *how we personally receive and respond* to everything they've learned—through grace and the theological virtues of faith, hope, and love.

## Retreat Vision

**Goal:** Move participants deeper into relationship with God who IS Love, through an authentically Catholic experience that integrates:
- **Teaching** - Solid catechesis on grace and the theological virtues
- **Personal Prayer** - Time for individual encounter with God
- **Communal Prayer** - Shared liturgical and devotional experiences
- **The Saints** - Companions and intercessors who model these virtues

**Foundation:** God's perfect love is the sacred gift of covenant which binds truth, justice, mercy and sacrifice into life-giving communion. The theological virtues are God's gifts that enable us to participate in His divine life and love.

## Theological Framework

### Grace: The Foundation
- **What Grace Is:** God's free and unmerited gift of His own divine life
- **How Grace Works:** Enables us to respond to God's call and live as His children
- **Sacramental Grace:** The seven sacraments as channels of grace

### The Theological Virtues
These are called "theological" because:
1. They have **God as their origin** - infused by God, not acquired by human effort
2. They have **God as their object** - directed toward God Himself
3. They have **God as their motive** - we practice them because of who God is

| Virtue | Definition | Gift | Response |
|--------|-----------|------|----------|
| **Faith** | Believing in God and all He has revealed | God reveals Himself | We trust and assent |
| **Hope** | Confident expectation of eternal life and the grace to attain it | God promises salvation | We trust His promises |
| **Love** | Loving God above all and neighbor as self for God's sake | God loves us first | We love in return |

## Working Definition of Perfect Love

For this retreat, we will use the comprehensive definition:

> **God's perfect love is the sacred gift of covenant which binds truth, justice, mercy and sacrifice into life-giving communion.**

This definition helps participants understand that:
- **Love is sacred** - set apart, holy, from God
- **Love is gift** - freely given, not earned
- **Love is covenantal** - permanent, binding, faithful
- **Love integrates** - truth, justice, mercy, sacrifice working together
- **Love creates communion** - relationship with God and neighbor

The theological virtues are God's gifts that enable us to receive and participate in this perfect love.
