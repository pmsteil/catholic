## Part 1: Teaching (30 minutes)

### Central Truth
> **We hope in God's promise of a share in his glory in Heaven. God's promises are trustworthy. Hope offers to us authentic joy and true courage, and sustains us in times of trial.**


### Opening (3 minutes)

*Connect to Sessions 1 & 2:* We've talked about grace—God giving us his life. We've talked about faith—saying "yes" to God. Now we come to hope. If faith says "I believe God exists and loves me," hope says "I trust that God will keep his promises."

Ask the group: *"What's the difference between hope and wishful thinking?"*

Hope isn't crossing your fingers. Hope is anchoring your soul to the faithfulness of God.


### Talking Point 1: Hope Is Anchored in God's Promises, Not Our Circumstances (8 minutes)

**Primary Scripture: Romans 5:1-5 (NABRE)**

> *"Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith to this grace in which we stand, and we boast in hope of the glory of God. Not only that, but we even boast of our afflictions, knowing that affliction produces endurance, and endurance, proven character, and proven character, hope, and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the holy Spirit that has been given to us."*

**Key points to emphasize:**
- Notice the progression: suffering → endurance → character → hope
- Hope doesn't come *despite* suffering—it often comes *through* suffering
- *"Hope does not disappoint"*—this is a bold claim. Why? Because it's anchored in God's love, not our circumstances.
- The Holy Spirit pours God's love into our hearts—hope is connected to experiencing God's love

**CCC 1817:** *"Hope is the theological virtue by which we desire the kingdom of heaven and eternal life as our happiness, placing our trust in Christ's promises and relying not on our own strength, but on the help of the grace of the Holy Spirit."*

Key phrase: *"relying not on our own strength."* Hope is not optimism about our abilities. It's confidence in God's faithfulness.


### Talking Point 2: Hope Gives Us a Reason to Live Differently (8 minutes)

**Primary Scripture: Jeremiah 29:11-13 (NABRE)**

> *"For I know well the plans I have in mind for you—oracle of the LORD—plans for your welfare and not for woe, so as to give you a future of hope. When you call me, and come and pray to me, I will listen to you. When you look for me, you will find me. Yes, when you seek me with all your heart."*

**Key points to emphasize:**
- God spoke these words to Israel *in exile*—when everything seemed lost
- Hope is not denial of present suffering; it's confidence in future redemption
- *"Plans for welfare and not for evil"*—God is for us, not against us
- *"You will seek me and find me"*—hope leads to seeking, and seeking leads to finding
- Hope reorders our priorities: If Heaven is real, then this life is preparation, not the main event

**What hope does:**
- Puts our problems in perspective—they're real, but they're not the end of the story
- Gives us courage to face difficulty—we know how the story ends
- Frees us from despair—even when things look hopeless, God is working
- Motivates holiness—if Heaven is our destination, we want to be ready


### Talking Point 3: The Enemies of Hope (8 minutes)

**Primary Scripture: Romans 8:24-25, 28 (NABRE)**

> *"For in hope we were saved. Now hope that sees for itself is not hope. For who hopes for what one sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait with endurance... We know that all things work for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose."*

**Key points to emphasize:**
- Hope requires patience—we don't see the fulfillment yet
- *"In everything God works for good"*—not "everything is good," but God works in everything

**Two sins against hope:**

**1. Despair** — Giving up on God's promises
- Believing your sins are too great to be forgiven
- Believing your situation is beyond God's help
- Believing that Heaven isn't real or isn't for you
- Despair says: "God can't" or "God won't"

**2. Presumption** — Taking God's promises for granted
- Assuming you'll be saved without conversion
- Expecting forgiveness without repentance
- Living however you want because "God is merciful"
- Presumption says: "God must" or "God owes me"

**CCC 2091:** *"Despair... is contrary to God's goodness, to his justice—for the Lord is faithful to his promises—and to his mercy."*

Hope walks the middle path: trusting God's mercy while taking his justice seriously.


### Closing (3 minutes)

Hope is what gets us through. When the diagnosis is bad, when the relationship is broken, when the future is uncertain—hope says, "God is faithful. He keeps his promises. This is not the end."

By faith, we believe. In hope, we trust. And hope prepares us for love—because when we're confident in God's love for us, we're freed to love others.

Now we're going to send you to spend time with Jesus in the Sanctuary. As you sit before him in the Blessed Sacrament, bring to him whatever is stirring in your heart about hope—your fears, your disappointments, your longing for something more. Just be with him.

**Let us pray**

> Lord Jesus, you are our hope—the anchor of our souls. We have heard your promises, and we know that you are faithful. Now send us into your presence. As we sit before you in the Blessed Sacrament, anchor our hearts in you. Where we are tempted to despair, give us confidence. Where we are tempted to presume, give us holy reverence. We go now to rest in the One who keeps his promises. In your holy name we pray. Amen.

*Please proceed quietly to the Sanctuary.*
