# Session 4: Love - Participating in God's Life

**Participant Notes**


## Central Truth

> **Love is the essence of the inner life of the Trinity. It is the soul of holiness and the basis upon which we will be judged. In Heaven, the faithful will live in the joy of perfect love.**


## Key Scripture

**1 John 4:8, 16** — *"God is love, and whoever remains in love remains in God and God in him."*

**John 13:34-35** — *"I give you a new commandment: love one another. As I have loved you, so you also should love one another. This is how all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."*

**John 15:12-13** — *"This is my commandment: love one another as I love you. No one has greater love than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends."*

**Matthew 25:40** — *"Whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me."*


## Key Terms to Know

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Charity** | The theological virtue of love; loving God above all things for his own sake, and our neighbor as ourselves for the love of God |
| **Acedia** | A form of spiritual laziness (also called sloth); refusing to engage with God's love |
| **Theological Virtue** | A virtue infused by God at Baptism, having God as its origin, object, and motive |
| **Mortal Sin** | A grave sin that destroys charity in the heart and separates us from God |
| **Venial Sin** | A lesser sin that wounds charity but does not destroy it |


## Lesson Outline

### 1. God IS Love—Not Just That He Loves

- *"God IS love"*—love is his very **nature**

- The Trinity is an **eternal communion of love**: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit giving themselves to each other

- We were created to **participate** in this love—to receive it and give it

- *"He who does not love does not know God"*—you cannot know God **without loving**

- Love is not optional for Christians—it's the very definition of what it means to follow Christ

**CCC 1822:** *"Charity is the theological virtue by which we love God above all things for his own sake, and our neighbor as ourselves for the love of God."*

Notice: We love God *for his own sake*—not for what we get from him. And we love neighbor *for the love of God*—not because they deserve it.

**Important:** The theological virtues—including love—are *infused* by God at Baptism (CCC 1266). We don't earn them; we receive them as gift.

### 2. Love Is a Command—Which Means It's a Choice

- Jesus **commands** us to love—love is an **act of the will**, not just a feeling

- *"As I have loved you"*—the standard is **Christ's love**, not human affection

- How did Jesus love? **Sacrificially. Unconditionally. To the point of death.**

- *"By this all men will know"*—love is the **mark** of a Christian

**What Love Is NOT:**
- A feeling (though feelings may accompany it)
- Approval of everything someone does
- Being "nice" or avoiding conflict
- Earned or deserved

**What Love IS:**
- **Willing the good** of the other
- **Self-gift**—giving yourself for the sake of another
- An **act of the will** that can be commanded and chosen
- The **fulfillment** of the entire law (Romans 13:10)
- The **bond of perfect harmony** that holds all virtues together (Colossians 3:14)

**Why Faith Can't Be Separated from Love:**

*"For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love."* (Galatians 5:6)

- **Love is the "form" of all the virtues** (CCC 1827)—it gives them their shape and direction
- **Faith** believes in God—but *why* do we believe? Because we love the One who reveals himself
- **Hope** trusts God's promises—but *why* do we trust? Because we love the One who promises
- **Every virtue** is ordered toward love—all of them flow from and lead back to love

St. Paul says love is *"the bond of perfection"* (Colossians 3:14)—it's the glue that holds all the virtues together.

**CCC 826:** Charity is the **soul of holiness**. You can have faith and hope without charity (as in mortal sin), but they cannot save you—they're like a body without a soul.

### 3. The Final Test—Love in Action

- This is the **basis on which we will be judged** (Matthew 25)

- Jesus doesn't ask about our theology or feelings—he asks about our **actions**

- *"As you did it to one of the least of these, you did it to me"*

- Love must be **concrete**—it must take action

- Faith and hope prepare us for love; love is the destination

**CCC 1826:** *"If I... have not charity, I am nothing... Charity is superior to all the virtues. It is the first of the theological virtues."*

**The Sins Against Love (CCC 2093-2094):**

| Sin | What It Is |
|-----|------------|
| **Indifference** | Not caring about God's love or the needs of others |
| **Ingratitude** | Taking God's love for granted, failing to give thanks |
| **Lukewarmness** | Half-hearted response to God's love |
| **Acedia** | Refusing to engage with God's love; spiritual laziness |
| **Hatred** | The direct opposite of love, wishing evil upon God or neighbor |

**How Sin Affects Love:**
- **Mortal sin** destroys charity in the heart—it kills love, even when faith and hope remain
- **Venial sin** wounds charity—it weakens our love but does not destroy it
- This is why we need the Sacrament of Reconciliation—to restore and heal our capacity to love

**Love and the Sacraments:**
- The **Eucharist** is the "Sacrament of Love"—Jesus stays with us because of love
- **Confession** restores our broken fellowship with the Father when sin has wounded or destroyed love

**Love and Prayer (CCC 2658):** Love is both the *source* of prayer and the *heights* of prayer. We pray because we love God. And the more we pray, the more we grow in love.

**Love and Justice (CCC 1889):** It is charity that enables us to act justly. Without love, we cannot give others what they are owed. Love *enables* justice.

## The Progression of the Day

| Virtue | What It Is | What It Does |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| **Grace** | God giving us his life | So that we **can** love |
| **Faith** | Saying "yes" to God | So that we **receive** his love |
| **Hope** | Trusting God's promises | So that we're **freed** to love without fear |
| **Love** | The destination | **Participating** in the very life of the Trinity |


## Key Takeaway

The question isn't *"Do you feel loving?"*

The question is *"Will you choose to love?"*

Jesus said: *"By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."*

**Not by your knowledge. Not by your attendance. Not by your feelings. By your love.**

## Act of Love

> O my God, I love you above all things, with my whole heart and soul, because you are all good and worthy of all my love. I love my neighbor as myself for the love of you. I forgive all who have injured me, and I ask pardon of all whom I have injured. **Amen.**
