# Session 1: Grace - Group Discussion (20 minutes)

*Participants return from the Sanctuary to share what God revealed to them during their time with Jesus.*


## Opening Question: What Is God Showing You? (10 minutes)

**"How is God helping you grow in your understanding of grace today? What revelations or insights did you receive during your time with Jesus?"**

*Facilitator notes:*
- This is the primary question—give it space and time
- Let participants share freely what they experienced in prayer
- Some may have had profound insights; others may have simply rested
- All responses are valid—God works differently in each person
- Listen for themes that emerge across the group


## Follow-Up Questions (if needed, 10 minutes)

*Use these only if the conversation needs prompting:*

**"Where in your life right now do you most need to hear that God's grace is enough? What would it look like to actually believe that?"**

*Facilitator notes:*
- Encourage specificity—not "my life in general" but "this relationship," "this struggle," "this fear"
- What would change if they truly believed grace was sufficient?

**"Many of us were raised to believe we have to earn everything we get. How does the idea that God's grace is completely free make you feel?"**

*Facilitator notes:*
- Some may feel relief ("I don't have to be perfect")
- Others may feel uncomfortable ("If I can't earn it, how do I know I have it?")
- Guide toward understanding that receiving a gift requires humility, not achievement
