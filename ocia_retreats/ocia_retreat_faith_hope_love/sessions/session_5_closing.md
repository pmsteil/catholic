## Tantum Ergo

*Sung or recited as the priest prepares to bless the people with the Blessed Sacrament:*

**Tantum ergo Sacraméntum**
**Venerémur cérnui:**
**Et antíquum documéntum**
**Novo cedat rítui:**
**Præstet fides suppleméntum**
**Sénsuum deféctui.**

**Genitóri, Genitóque**
**Laus et jubilátio,**
**Salus, honor, virtus quoque**
**Sit et benedíctio:**
**Procedénti ab utróque**
**Compar sit laudátio. Amen.**

*English translation:*

*Down in adoration falling,*
*Lo! the sacred Host we hail,*
*Lo! oe'r ancient forms departing*
*Newer rites of grace prevail;*
*Faith for all defects supplying,*
*Where the feeble senses fail.*

*To the everlasting Father,*
*And the Son Who reigns on high*
*With the Holy Spirit proceeding*
*Forth from each eternally,*
*Be salvation, honor, blessing,*
*Might and endless majesty. Amen.*

## The Blessing

*The priest or deacon takes the monstrance and makes the Sign of the Cross over the people in silence.*

*The people bow their heads in reverence as the blessing is given.*

---

## Reposition

*After the blessing, the Blessed Sacrament is reposed in the tabernacle.*

*The people may sing or recite:*

**Holy God, We Praise Thy Name**

Holy God, we praise Thy name;
Lord of all, we bow before Thee!
All on earth Thy scepter claim,
All in Heaven above adore Thee;
Infinite Thy vast domain,
Everlasting is Thy reign.

Hark! the loud celestial hymn
Angel choirs above are raising,
Cherubim and seraphim,
In unceasing chorus praising;
Fill the heavens with sweet accord:
Holy, holy, holy, Lord.

Holy Father, Holy Son,
Holy Spirit, Three we name Thee;
While in essence only One,
Undivided God we claim Thee;
And adoring bend the knee,
While we own the mystery.

## Closing Prayer for the Retreat

*The priest or retreat leader may add:*

Lord Jesus Christ,
you have fed us with your Word and Sacrament throughout this day.
You have poured out your grace upon us
and strengthened our faith, hope, and love.

Send us forth now as witnesses to your perfect love—
love that is sacred, sacrificial, and covenantal,
love that binds truth, justice, and mercy
into life-giving communion.

May the theological virtues you have planted in our hearts
bear fruit in our daily lives,
that all we meet may encounter your love through us.

We ask this through the intercession of Mary, our Mother,
and all the saints who have gone before us.

**All:** Amen.

*The retreat concludes. Participants depart in silence or with quiet music.*
