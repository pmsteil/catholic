## Part 1: Teaching (30 minutes)

### Central Truth
> **We believe because of the authority of God who reveals. Our response is a gift of his grace. We must remain steadfast in faith to see God.**

---

### Opening (3 minutes)

*Connect to Session 1:* We just talked about grace—God giving us his very life. But how do we receive that gift? Through faith. Faith is how we say "yes" to what God is offering.

Ask the group: *"What's the difference between knowing about someone and actually trusting them?"*

That's the difference between information about God and faith in God.

### Talking Point 1: Faith Is Personal Trust, Not Just Information (8 minutes)

**Primary Scripture: John 14:1-6 (NABRE)**

> *"Do not let your hearts be troubled. You have faith in God; have faith also in me. In my Father's house there are many dwelling places. If there were not, would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back again and take you to myself, so that where I am you also may be. Where I am going you know the way." Thomas said to him, "Master, we do not know where you are going; how can we know the way?" Jesus said to him, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."*

**Key points to emphasize:**
- Jesus doesn't say "believe these facts about me"—he says "believe *in* me"
- Faith is personal trust in a Person, not just intellectual agreement with doctrines
- "Let not your hearts be troubled"—faith is meant to bring peace, not anxiety
- Jesus claims to be *the* way—not *a* way. This is exclusive, but it's also an invitation.

**CCC 1814:** *"Faith is the theological virtue by which we believe in God and believe all that he has said and revealed to us, and that Holy Church proposes for our belief, because he is truth itself."*

The key phrase: *"because he is truth itself."* We don't believe because we've figured everything out. We believe because God cannot lie.

### Talking Point 2: Faith Is a Gift We Must Choose to Receive (8 minutes)

**Primary Scripture: Mark 9:21-24 (NABRE)**

> *"And he asked his father, 'How long has this been happening to him?' He replied, 'Since childhood. It has often thrown him into fire and into water to kill him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.' Jesus said to him, '"If you can!" Everything is possible to one who has faith.' Then the boy's father cried out, 'I do believe, help my unbelief!'"*

**Key points to emphasize:**
- This father is honest: "I believe; help my unbelief!" This is the most honest prayer.
- Faith is a gift from God—we can't manufacture it on our own
- But we must *choose* to receive it and cooperate with it
- Faith can grow or shrink depending on how we nurture it
- Doubt is not the opposite of faith—*refusal* is the opposite of faith

**How faith grows:**
- Prayer—asking God for more faith
- The sacraments—especially Eucharist and Confession
- Scripture and the teaching of the Church
- Community with other believers
- Acting on the faith we have (faith without works is dead)

**How faith weakens:**
- Neglecting prayer and the sacraments
- Surrounding ourselves only with unbelief
- Refusing to act on what we know to be true
- Letting other things become more important than God

---

### Talking Point 3: Faith Is the Foundation for Everything Else (8 minutes)

**Primary Scripture: Hebrews 11:1, 6 (NABRE)**

> *"Faith is the realization of what is hoped for and evidence of things not seen... But without faith it is impossible to please him, for anyone who approaches God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him."*

**Key points to emphasize:**
- Faith is "assurance" and "conviction"—not wishful thinking, but confident trust
- We believe in things we cannot see—but that doesn't mean they're not real
- *"Without faith it is impossible to please God"*—this is sobering
- Faith is the door through which we enter relationship with God
- By faith, we believe; in hope, we trust his promises; in love, we respond

**The connection to love:**
- Faith is not the end—it's the beginning
- Faith opens us to receive God's love
- Faith leads to hope, and hope leads to love
- "Faith working through love" (Galatians 5:6)—faith that doesn't lead to love isn't real faith

---

### Closing (3 minutes)

Faith is saying "yes" to God—yes to his existence, yes to his revelation, yes to his love. It's not a blind leap into the dark; it's a trusting step toward the Light.

The father in Mark's Gospel gives us the perfect prayer: *"I believe; help my unbelief!"* That's where most of us live—somewhere between belief and doubt. And Jesus doesn't reject that. He works with it.

Now we're going to send you to spend time with Jesus in the Sanctuary. As you sit before him in the Blessed Sacrament, bring to him whatever is stirring in your heart about faith—your doubts, your questions, your desire to trust more deeply. Just be with him.

**Let us pray**

> Lord Jesus, you are the Way, the Truth, and the Life. We have heard your call to faith—to trust in you, not just to know about you. Now send us into your presence. As we sit before you in the Blessed Sacrament, help us to bring our doubts, our fears, and our unbelief. Meet us there. Increase our faith. We go now to be with you, the One in whom we place our trust. In your holy name we pray. Amen.

*Please proceed quietly to the Sanctuary.*

---

## Part 2: Group Discussion (20 minutes)

*Participants return from the Sanctuary to share what God revealed to them during their time with Jesus.*

---

### Opening Question: What Is God Showing You? (10 minutes)

**"How is God helping you grow in faith today? What revelations or insights did you receive during your time with Jesus?"**

*Facilitator notes:*
- This is the primary question—give it space and time
- Let participants share freely what they experienced in prayer
- Some may have wrestled with doubts; others may have felt peace
- All responses are valid—God works differently in each person
- Listen for themes that emerge across the group

---

### Follow-Up Questions (if needed, 10 minutes)

*Use these only if the conversation needs prompting:*

**"What makes it hard for you to trust God? Is it something from your past? Something you've seen? Something you don't understand?"**

*Facilitator notes:*
- This question invites honesty about obstacles to faith
- Common answers: past hurts, unanswered prayers, suffering in the world
- Don't try to "fix" people's doubts—let them name them
- Connect to the father's prayer: "Help my unbelief"

**"Where in your life is God asking you to act on faith—to do something that requires trusting him even though you can't see the outcome?"**

*Facilitator notes:*
- Encourage specificity: a conversation, a decision, a change, a risk
- What would it look like to take one step of faith this week?
