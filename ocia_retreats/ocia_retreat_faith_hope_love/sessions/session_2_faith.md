## Part 1: Teaching (30 minutes)

### Central Truth
> **We believe because of the authority of God who reveals. Our response is a gift of his grace. We must remain steadfast in faith to see God.**

---

### Opening (3 minutes)

*Connect to Session 1:* We just talked about grace—God giving us his very life. But how do we receive that gift? Through faith. Faith is how we say "yes" to what God is offering.

Ask the group: *"What's the difference between knowing about someone and actually trusting them?"*

That's the difference between information about God and faith in God.

### Talking Point 1: Faith Is Personal Trust, Not Just Information (8 minutes)

**Primary Scripture: John 14:1-6 (NABRE)**

> *"Do not let your hearts be troubled. You have faith in God; have faith also in me. In my Father's house there are many dwelling places. If there were not, would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back again and take you to myself, so that where I am you also may be. Where I am going you know the way." Thomas said to him, "Master, we do not know where you are going; how can we know the way?" Jesus said to him, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."*

**Key points to emphasize:**
- Jesus doesn't say "believe these facts about me"—he says "believe *in* me"
- Faith is personal trust in a Person, not just intellectual agreement with doctrines
- "Let not your hearts be troubled"—faith is meant to bring peace, not anxiety
- Jesus claims to be *the* way—not *a* way. This is exclusive, but it's also an invitation.

**CCC 1814:** *"Faith is the theological virtue by which we believe in God and believe all that he has said and revealed to us, and that Holy Church proposes for our belief, because he is truth itself."*

The key phrase: *"because he is truth itself."* We don't believe because we've figured everything out. We believe because God cannot lie.

### Talking Point 2: Faith Is a Gift We Must Choose to Receive (8 minutes)

**Primary Scripture: Mark 9:21-24 (NABRE)**

> *"And he asked his father, 'How long has this been happening to him?' He replied, 'Since childhood. It has often thrown him into fire and into water to kill him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.' Jesus said to him, '"If you can!" Everything is possible to one who has faith.' Then the boy's father cried out, 'I do believe, help my unbelief!'"*

**Key points to emphasize:**
- This father is honest: "I believe; help my unbelief!" This is the most honest prayer.
- Faith is a gift from God—we can't manufacture it on our own
- But we must *choose* to receive it and cooperate with it
- Faith can grow or shrink depending on how we nurture it
- Doubt is not the opposite of faith—*refusal* is the opposite of faith

**How faith grows:**
- Prayer—asking God for more faith
- The sacraments—especially Eucharist and Confession
- Scripture and the teaching of the Church
- Community with other believers
- Acting on the faith we have (faith without works is dead)

**How faith weakens:**
- Neglecting prayer and the sacraments
- Surrounding ourselves only with unbelief
- Refusing to act on what we know to be true
- Letting other things become more important than God

---

### Talking Point 3: Faith Is the Foundation for Everything Else (8 minutes)

**Primary Scripture: Hebrews 11:1, 6 (NABRE)**

> *"Faith is the realization of what is hoped for and evidence of things not seen... But without faith it is impossible to please him, for anyone who approaches God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him."*

**Key points to emphasize:**
- Faith is "assurance" and "conviction"—not wishful thinking, but confident trust
- We believe in things we cannot see—but that doesn't mean they're not real
- *"Without faith it is impossible to please God"*—this is sobering
- Faith is the door through which we enter relationship with God
- By faith, we believe; in hope, we trust his promises; in love, we respond

**The connection to love:**
- Faith is not the end—it's the beginning
- Faith opens us to receive God's love
- Faith leads to hope, and hope leads to love
- "Faith working through love" (Galatians 5:6)—faith that doesn't lead to love isn't real faith

---

### Closing (3 minutes)

Faith is saying "yes" to God—yes to his existence, yes to his revelation, yes to his love. It's not a blind leap into the dark; it's a trusting step toward the Light.

The father in Mark's Gospel gives us the perfect prayer: *"I believe; help my unbelief!"* That's where most of us live—somewhere between belief and doubt. And Jesus doesn't reject that. He works with it.

*Transition to discussion...*

---

## Part 2: Group Discussion (30 minutes)

*Allow approximately 10 minutes per question. These questions build on Session 1, moving participants from recognizing their need for grace to examining their willingness to trust God.*

---

### Question 1: The Struggle to Trust (10 minutes)

**"In Session 1, we talked about receiving grace. But receiving requires trust. What makes it hard for you to trust God? Is it something from your past? Something you've seen? Something you don't understand?"**

*Facilitator notes:*
- This question invites honesty about obstacles to faith
- Common answers: past hurts, unanswered prayers, suffering in the world, hypocrisy in the Church
- Don't try to "fix" people's doubts—let them name them
- The goal is honest acknowledgment, not resolution (yet)
- Connect to the father's prayer: "Help my unbelief"

---

### Question 2: Faith vs. Certainty (10 minutes)

**"Faith is 'the conviction of things not seen.' If God wanted us to believe, why doesn't he just show himself clearly and remove all doubt? What might be the purpose of faith requiring trust rather than proof?"**

*Facilitator notes:*
- This is a deep theological question—don't rush to easy answers
- Possible directions: Love requires freedom; proof would compel, not invite
- Faith is relational—you can't have a relationship with a mathematical proof
- God gives enough evidence to believe, but not so much that we're forced
- Connect to Jesus blessing those "who have not seen and yet believe" (John 20:29)

---

### Question 3: Acting on Faith (10 minutes)

**"James says 'faith without works is dead.' Where in your life is God asking you to act on faith—to do something that requires trusting him even though you can't see the outcome? What's holding you back?"**

*Facilitator notes:*
- This question moves from concept to commitment
- Encourage specificity: a conversation, a decision, a change, a risk
- What would it look like to take one step of faith this week?
- Connect to the progression: Grace enables → Faith responds → Action follows
- This prepares them for the deeper questions in Sessions 3 and 4

---

## Part 3: Prayer with Jesus (15 minutes)

*In the Sanctuary, before the Blessed Sacrament*

Guide participants to:
1. Sit quietly in the presence of Jesus—the One in whom we place our faith
2. Bring to him any doubts, fears, or obstacles to trust
3. Pray the father's prayer: "Lord, I believe; help my unbelief"
4. Ask for the grace to take one step of faith

*Close with the Act of Faith:*

> O my God, I firmly believe that you are one God in three divine Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. I believe that your divine Son became man and died for our sins, and that he will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe these and all the truths which the holy Catholic Church teaches, because you have revealed them, who can neither deceive nor be deceived. Amen.
