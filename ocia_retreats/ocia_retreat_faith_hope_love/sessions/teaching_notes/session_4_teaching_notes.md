# Session 4: Love (Charity) - Teaching Notes

## Part 1: Catechist Preparation

**Consider the following statement:** Love is the essence of the inner life of the Trinity. It is the soul of holiness and the basis upon which we will be judged. In Heaven, the faithful will live in the joy of perfect love.

### Keeping the above statement in mind, read and meditate on the following passages:

**Proclamation:** Love is the essence of the inner life of the Trinity. It is the soul of holiness and the basis upon which we will be judged. In Heaven, the faithful will live in the joy of perfect love.

### Explanation:

**God, love itself, is the origin of love and shows us what love is** (see 1 Jn 4:9-10, 16)
- The Trinity is a family of Persons whose life is mutual, total self-giving love
- All creation is an act of God's love; we were created by Love, for love
- God manifested his love in his all-encompassing, steadfast love for his Chosen People through history
- The Father sent love incarnate, his Son, to earth to die to save his beloved creatures
- Because of love, our Savior stays with us in the Eucharist, the Sacrament of Love
- Because of love, our Savior offers us mercy in Confession to restore our broken fellowship with the Father
- God's love, offered through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, destines us to share life with him forever

**Love as a Christian virtue** (see Jn 14:35-35, Jn 15:12-17)
- *"IF YOU LOVE ME OBEY, AND I WILL GIVE YOU ANOTHER ADVOCATE OF TRUTH"* *(handwritten note)*
- *"LOVE AS I LOVE YOU, NO GREATER LOVE THAN THIS..."* *(handwritten note)*
- Jesus taught us what love is: putting God first, love of neighbor even when the neighbor is an enemy, love so powerful and complete that love is the sign of the Christian
- Jesus can command us to love because love is an act of the will, not an emotion
- The Holy Spirit's grace purifies our human ability to love and raises it to the perfection of divine love
- Love animates our moral life, giving us the spiritual freedom of the children of God
- Love inclines our will to act with ease and delight in exercising friendship with God
- The "final test" for Heaven is the test of love (see Mt 25:31-46)
- Faith and hope are necessary: hope give us a reason to act, faith prompts us to love

**Life without love** (see 1 Jn 3:1-18) — *"11-24 — WONDERFUL SUMMARY"* *(handwritten note)*
- Sin is a failure of love for God and neighbor and so it kills love, even when faith and hope remain
- Mortal sin destroys love; venial sin wounds love
- Sins against love include indifference, ingratitude, lukewarmness, acedia (sloth), and hatred of God and neighbor

**Love is indispensable** (see 1 Cor 13:1-13)
- Love is the greatest of the virtues and the highest and strongest act of the will
- Love is not "something to do"; it is the point of all doing and our vocation from God
- Having everything but lacking love means being nothing at all
- Love inspires us to a life of self-giving, with Jesus' sacrifice on the cross as our model
- Love binds the Christian life together in perfect harmony and assures the unity of the Church
- Love calls us to justice and makes it possible
- Love is the source of our prayer, and through love we reach the heights of prayer

### Application — Suggested Questions for Discussion:

1. How is Jesus our model for our daily lives as Christians?
2. What does the Church mean when she teaches us to hate the sin, but love the sinner?
3. What are some of the biggest challenges that I face when trying to live a Christian life of charity?
4. How do I show love to people I don't like, people who don't like me, or people who have hurt me? Is it enough to just pray for someone I don't like or even detest?
5. What is the difference between God's divine love and our human love? Is loving in a divine way possible for a human?

### Celebration — Suggestions for Closing Prayer:

1. Ask God to increase the virtue of love in each of us and for the grace to follow Jesus' example of perfect love
2. Hymn or song (see previous page for suggestions)
3. Pray together Act of Love (see handout on Well-Known Catholic Prayers from *Participant's Book*)
