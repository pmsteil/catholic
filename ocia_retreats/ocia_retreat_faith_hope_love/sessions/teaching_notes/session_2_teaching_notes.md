**Proclamation:** We believe because of the authority of God who reveals. Our response is a gift of his grace. We must remain steadfast in faith to see God.

### Explanation:

**The theological virtues: faith, hope, and love (charity)** (see 1 Pt 1:3-9)
- These virtues are directly to God, who desires eternal fellowship with us
- By faith, we believe in God; by hope, we cling to God; by charity, we love God
- They dispose us for eternal life with the Trinity and are thus necessary for salvation
- They are the source and developed gifts from God at Baptism

**The root of the supernatural life** (see Eph 2:1-10)
- Faith is more certain than all that is revealed, for God is the source of each
- The object of our faith is the Deposit of Faith: what God has revealed to us
- God's revelation is more certain than all human knowledge because it is God's own truth
- Faith and reason are always in agreement, for God is the source of both
- Reason prepares us for faith, and helps us to see the reasonableness of faith
- Faith is not a blind leap, but rather enlightens our knowledge of and trust in God's authority
- Faith is to doubt and hesitate, but rather enlightens and understanding
- Faith is the basis and stimulus for our hope

**Faith — always a deliberate choice** (see Eph 6:10-18)
- Perseverance in faith is always a deliberate choice, not difficulty to him
- We can know God by reason and revelation; faith does not oppose reason
- Marks of faith: God's invitation to know him; by faith and submit in obedience
- Choosing to be influenced by the bad example of some believers
- Choosing to obediently submit to the Church's teaching, leading to schism, heresy, and apostasy
- Revolting against God by deliberately doubting or rejecting him, or outright hostility to religion

**Ways to lose faith:**
- Persistence in ignorance of God or of his revelation, or difficulty to him
- Misplaced priorities, such as a love of riches or power (see 1 Tim 6:10)
- Choosing to be influenced by the bad example of some believers
- Choosing to obediently submit to the Church's teaching, leading to schism, heresy, and apostasy
- Revolting against God by deliberately doubting or rejecting him, or outright hostility to religion

**Ways to obtain or increase faith** (see 1 Tm 6:20)
- Ask the Holy Spirit for faith in prayer
- Participate devoutly and frequently in the sacraments, especially the Eucharist and Confession
- Read apostolic works, most especially Sacred Scripture, the Catechism, and lives of the saints
- Seek the companionship of true believers
- Exercise faith by professing it, declaring it, and doing good works (see Jas 2:14-26)

### Application — Suggested Questions for Discussion:

1. Why does the modern culture often seem closed to the possibility of faith in God?
2. Why is faith in God that only God himself could give us?
3. Why would a gift that only God himself could give us?
4. Why is it important that just show faith himself directly and obviously to us?
active?

### Celebration — Suggestions for Closing Prayer:

1. Ask God for the desire to accept the gift of faith that he offers, and the grace to increase our faith daily
2. Hymn or song (see previous page for suggestions)
3. Pray together Act of Faith (see handout on Well-Known Catholic Prayers from *Participant's Book*)
