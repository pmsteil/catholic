## Part 2: Catechetical Session

### Preparation — Liturgy of the Word:
If beginning with a hymn or song, see previous page for suggestions

| Element | Reference |
|---------|-----------|
| First Reading: | Rom 5:1-5 |
| Response: | Ps 27:1-6, 8-9, 11-14 |
| Gospel: | Mt 5:3-12 |

**Proclamation:** We hope in God's promise of a share in his glory in Heaven. God's promises are trustworthy. Hope offers to us authentic joy and true courage, and sustains us in times of trial.

### Explanation:

**The nature of hope: to know that the story of our salvation ends in victory** (see Eph 1:11-23)
- It is a yearning for what we lack
  - We know that our bodily well-being and existence will not last
  - Our immortal soul yearns for immortality, and God alone meets that eternal longing
  - We seek a happiness that is permanent
- Christian hope is the confident expectation of a future life of happiness with God
  - Responds to the desire for happiness God has placed on our hearts
  - Centers on God and on what he promised and can deliver
- By faith, we hope; in hope, we love

**The consequences of hope** (see Rom 5:1-5)
- Hope puts our priorities in order: Our relationship with God and attaining eternity are our purpose in life
- Jesus teaches us the Beatitudes that we can hope for happiness if we are virtuous and seek God
- Hope buoys us up amid the difficulties of life
  - Our problems here on earth are seen in clearer perspective, so that we do not become discouraged or feel abandoned by God
  - Spiritual difficulties are seen as steps on our journey to holiness and Heaven
  - We can experience joy even in the midst of trials and suffering
- We turn to the Holy Spirit for help and grace, rather than rely on our own strength
- Purgatory gives us hope, for it shows us how much God wants us to be with him in Heaven

**Sins against hope** (see Wis 1:16-2:5 and Rom 2:1-8)
- Despair manifests...
  - A disbelief in the attainability of Heaven
  - A grave distrust of the Almighty, his love for us, and his goodness, justice, and mercy
  - A failure to understand the true nature of God and the reasons for the Incarnation and the Paschal mystery of Jesus that makes possible forgiveness of all sin
- Presumption manifests...
  - A belief that we can save ourselves, by ourselves
  - That we do not want divine assistance, that is, an overindulgence in self-sufficiency
  - An assumption that attaining eternal happiness is not difficult and that there is no need to convert one's heart to God or strive for holiness with all our strength

**Hope fosters prayer: the desire to see the Father** (see Rom 15:4-13)
- The Holy Spirit teaches us to pray in hope of all that our Heavenly Father wants to give us
- The Mass, the Prayer of the Church, the Scriptures, the Lord's Prayer, and personal prayer nourish hope in us

### Application — Suggested Questions for Discussion:

1. How does our understanding of God's love for us inspire us to hope?
2. Have you needed hope during a difficult situation?
3. When are we most likely to lose hope?
4. What would life be like if we did not have hope of Heaven, or of anything beyond death?

### Celebration — Suggestions for Closing Prayer:

1. Ask God to give each one true hope of Heaven and sainthood, and to increase each one's hope daily
2. Hymn or song (see previous page for suggestions)
3. Pray together Act of Hope (see handout on Well-Known Catholic Prayers from *Participant's Book*)
