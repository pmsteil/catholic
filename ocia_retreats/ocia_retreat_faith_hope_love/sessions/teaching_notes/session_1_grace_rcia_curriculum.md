# Session 1: Grace - Teaching Notes


## Part 1: Catechist Preparation

**Consider the following statement:** God gives his own life and friendship to us. We call this gift grace. We do not earn or deserve God's grace. Grace allows us to become God's adopted children and to respond to his abundant love.

**Proclamation:** God gives his own life and friendship to us. We call this gift grace. We do not earn or deserve God's grace. Grace allows us to become God's adopted children and to respond to his abundant love.

### Explanation:

**The purpose of grace: to give God's own supernatural life to us** (see Eph 2:1-10)
- In the beginning God created us and endowed us with grace, which was lost by Adam's sin
- That grace came to restore God's grace to us; we receive all grace by the merit of his Paschal mystery
- Jesus came to restore God's grace to us; we receive all grace by the merit of his Paschal mystery
- We can know grace by its fruits, working in us by the power of the Holy Spirit (see Mt 7:17-20 and Gal 5:22-25)

**Actual grace: a gift of God when we need it or seek his help** (see 1 Cor 15:10 and Phil 2:13)
- Grace is more certain than all that is revealed, for God is the source of each
- The object of our faith is the Deposit of Faith: what God has revealed to us
- Through Jesus we gain grace; God's grace is poured out through the Holy Spirit
- Our justification comes as a gift of God's grace through redemption in Christ Jesus
- Actual grace prompts us to do a good or avoid an evil
- We can resist grace because God respects our free will
- All Baptized persons are given grace that we might choose, gifts given to the purpose of each

**Sanctifying (habitual) grace: preparing us for union with God** (see 2 Pt 1:3-4)
- At Baptism we receive sanctifying grace, the indwelling of the Holy Spirit
- (see Jn 3:5 and Rom 6:3-11)
- Sanctifying grace justifies us so that our sins are truly forgiven; they are not merely covered over but are really taken away
- By sanctifying grace, we are reborn with new powers (see 2 Cor 5:17) and are really transformed
- Our intellect and will are empowered to know and love in a new way
- The theological gifts of the Holy Spirit, to begin a new work of creation in us
- We receive the gifts of the Holy Spirit
- We become members of the Church, the Body of Christ
- Grace elevates us; grace in life in thought, our faith and the sacraments
- Grace and justification come together

**Sanctifying grace confers sanctifying grace:**
- Sanctifying grace is not just a state to be in or out of; it is a way of life
- Charisms are special graces to help those with specific ministries or responsibilities
- Graces of state are special graces intended for the sake of the Church as a whole

**Loss and increase in grace** (see 1 Cor 10:12 and Phil 2:12)
- We can lose grace by doing evil and rejecting God's grace
- We increase in grace by doing good
- God will respond to our prayers for actual graces
- Sanctifying grace is lost through mortal sin
- Sanctifying grace is restored through the sacrament of Reconciliation, sanctifying grace

### Application — Suggested Questions for Discussion:

1. What situation have I been in that only God's grace could give me?
2. Do I have to accept God's grace?
3. Why is sanctifying (or sacramental) grace not something to which we have an automatic right?
4. How would our view of life's disappointments change if we saw everything in life as a gift from God?

### Celebration — Suggestions for Closing Prayer:

1. Pray for openness to respond to God's grace leading you closer to him
2. Hymn or song (see previous page for suggestions)
3. Pray together Psalm 36 or Psalm 138 (see handout on Well-Known Catholic Prayers from *Participant's Book*)
