## The Leap That Isn't Blind

You have been on a journey. You have learned that God exists, that He answers the problem of evil with love. You have encountered the Trinity, traced God's covenant plan, and met Jesus Christ—the Answer Incarnate. You have discovered the Church, Scripture, Tradition, the Mass, the saints.

You know so much more than when you started. And yet—knowing is not the same as believing.

Faith is not pretending to be certain when you're not. Faith is not checking your brain at the door. Faith is responding to a God who has already reached out to you—a God who reveals Himself through Scripture and Tradition, through the Church, through the sacraments—and waits for your response.

**St. John Henry Newman** described his own journey this way:

> *"Ten thousand difficulties do not make one doubt."*

You can have questions. You can struggle. You can wrestle. That's not the opposite of faith—that's often how faith grows. What matters is that you keep turning toward the One who created you, who loves you, who is calling you to a life in Him.

## Faith Built on Grace

In our first session, we reflected on grace—God's free gift of Himself. Now we see that faith is our response to that gift.

Grace comes first. Always. God reveals Himself before we seek Him. God loves us before we love Him. God calls us before we answer.

Faith is simply saying *yes* to what God has already done.

- **Grace** is God reaching out to us.
- **Faith** is us reaching back.
- **Hope** will be trusting where that relationship leads.
- **Love** will be living fully in that relationship.

Without grace, we could not believe. But grace has been given. The question now is: Will you believe?

**St. Augustine**, after years of running from God, finally surrendered:

> *"Late have I loved you, Beauty so ancient and so new, late have I loved you! You were within me, but I was outside... You called, you shouted, and you broke through my deafness."*

God is calling. He is breaking through. Faith is hearing that call and responding.

## Reflection Questions

*Sit quietly with Jesus. Let these questions rest in your heart.*

---

**1. What has God done to reveal Himself to me?**

A person? An experience? A longing that won't go away?

**3. What would it mean for me to say "yes" to God today?**

Not a perfect yes. Not a certain yes. Just an honest yes.

## A Prayer for Faith

*Pray this slowly, from your heart:*

> **Lord Jesus, I want to believe.**
>
> I bring You my doubts, my questions, my uncertainties.
> I bring You the parts of me that struggle to trust.
> I bring You my whole self—not just the parts that feel ready.
>
> You have revealed Yourself to me in ways I'm only beginning to understand.
> Help me to see. Help me to hear. Help me to respond.
>
> I believe, Lord. Help my unbelief.
>
> **Amen.**

## Traditional Prayer: Act of Faith

*This ancient prayer expresses the heart of what it means to believe. Pray it slowly, making each phrase your own.*

> **O my God, I firmly believe that you are one God in three divine Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.**
>
> **I believe that your divine Son became man and died for our sins, and that he will come to judge the living and the dead.**
>
> **I believe these and all the truths which the holy Catholic Church teaches, because you have revealed them, who can neither deceive nor be deceived.**
>
> **Amen.**

## Closing Prayer: The Anima Christi

*Ask Christ to deepen your faith as you pray:*

> **Soul of Christ, sanctify me.**
> Body of Christ, save me.
> Blood of Christ, inebriate me.
> Water from the side of Christ, wash me.
> Passion of Christ, strengthen me.
> O good Jesus, hear me.
> Within your wounds, hide me.
> Permit me not to be separated from you.
> From the wicked foe, defend me.
> At the hour of my death, call me
> and bid me come to you,
> that with your saints I may praise you
> forever and ever.
> **Amen.**

*We do not walk this journey alone. The saints who have gone before us intercede for us. Ask for their prayers:*

> Holy Mary, Seat of Wisdom, **pray for us.**
>
> St. John Paul II, our parish patron, **pray for us.**
>
> St. John Henry Newman, **pray for us.**
>
> St. Augustine, **pray for us.**
>
> All holy men and women, **pray for us.**

---

## As You Leave

*While making the Sign of the Cross, pray:*

> **In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.**
>
> **I believe, Lord. Help my unbelief.**
> **Amen.**

You have taken another step. Faith grows not by having all the answers, but by continuing to walk toward the One who is the Answer.

Go in peace. The journey continues.
