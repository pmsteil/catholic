## Session Overview

## Part 1: Teaching (30 minutes)

### Central Truth
> **We believe because God, the Author of Creation, reality, truth, love  reveals all that is true, good, and beautiful. Our response is a gift of his grace. We must remain steadfast in faith to see God.**


### Opening (3 minutes)

*Connect to Session 1:* We just talked about grace—God giving us his very life. But how do we receive that gift? Through faith. Faith is how we say "yes" to what God is offering.

Ask the group: *"What's the difference between knowing about someone and actually trusting them?"*

That's the difference between information about God and faith in God.


### Key Terms to Know

- **Theological Virtues:** Faith, hope, and love—infused by God at Baptism, directed toward God Himself, and necessary for salvation (CCC 1812-1813)
- **Deposit of Faith:** The heritage of faith contained in Sacred Scripture and Tradition, handed on in the Church from the Apostles—this is *what* we believe (CCC 84)

### Talking Point 1: Faith Is Personal Trust, Not Just Information (8 minutes)

**Primary Scripture: John 14:1-6 (NABRE)**

> *"Do not let your hearts be troubled. You have faith in God; have faith also in me. In my Father's house there are many dwelling places. If there were not, would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back again and take you to myself, so that where I am you also may be. Where I am going you know the way." Thomas said to him, "Master, we do not know where you are going; how can we know the way?" Jesus said to him, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."*

**Key points to emphasize:**
- When you hear the word "faith" - think "trust in Jesus"
- The Greek word for faith (*pistis*) always orbits around trust—whether it's the act of trusting God, His trustworthiness, the proof that grounds our trust, or "the faith" (the content of what we trust Him for). It all points to personal trust in a Person.
- Jesus doesn't say "trust these facts about me"—he says "trust *in* me"
- Jesus claims to be *the* way—not *a* way. This is exclusive, but it's also an invitation.
- Faith is trust in His Grace - Trusting the Author of all that is true

**CCC 1814:** *"Faith is the theological virtue by which we believe in God and believe all that he has said and revealed to us, and that Holy Church proposes for our belief, because he is truth itself. By faith 'man freely commits his entire self to God.' For this reason the believer seeks to know and do God's will. 'The righteous shall live by faith.' Living faith 'works through charity.'"*

**CCC 1815:** *"The gift of faith remains in one who has not sinned against it. But 'faith apart from works is dead': when it is deprived of hope and love, faith does not fully unite the believer to Christ and does not make him a living member of his Body."*

Faith is not separate from love, but is the first step in truly loving God. Without trust, we cannot love.

Think about this in human terms: **What happens when someone betrays your trust?** Your ability to trust them is shattered. You can never be sure what they'll do. You can never be sure if they'll be there for you when you need them. Your ability to love them fully is broken.

But with God, our trust is well-placed. The key phrase: *"because he is truth itself."* We don't believe because we've figured everything out. We believe because God is Truth.

**Faith and reason work together:** Faith is not a blind leap—it does not oppose reason. God is the source of both faith and reason, so they can never truly contradict each other (CCC 35). Reason prepares us for faith and helps us see its reasonableness; faith enlightens reason and opens us to truths beyond what reason alone can discover.


### Talking Point 2: Faith Is a Gift We Must Choose to Receive (8 minutes)

**Primary Scripture: Mark 9:21-24 (NABRE)**

> *"And he asked his father, 'How long has this been happening to him?' He replied, 'Since childhood. It has often thrown him into fire and into water to kill him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.' Jesus said to him, '"If you can!" Everything is possible to one who has faith.' Then the boy's father cried out, 'I do believe, help my unbelief!'"*

**Key points to emphasize:**
- This father is honest: "I believe; help my unbelief!" This is the most honest prayer.
- Faith is a gift from God—we can't manufacture it on our own
- But we must *choose* to receive it and cooperate with it
- Faith can grow or shrink depending on how we nurture it

**Key insight from CCC 2089:** Doubt is not the opposite of faith—*refusal* is the opposite of faith. We can have questions and still believe. What matters is whether we keep saying "yes" to God.

**Faith can grow or weaken** depending on how we nurture it:
- It grows through prayer, the sacraments, Scripture, community, and acting on what we believe
- It weakens when we neglect these things or let other priorities crowd out God


### Talking Point 3: Faith Is the Foundation for Everything Else (8 minutes)

**Primary Scripture: Hebrews 11:1, 6 (NABRE)**

> *"Faith is the realization of what is hoped for and evidence of things not seen... But without faith it is impossible to please him, for anyone who approaches God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him."*

**Key points to emphasize:**
- Faith is "assurance" and "conviction"—not wishful thinking, but confident trust
- We believe in things we cannot see—but that doesn't mean they're not real
- *"Without faith it is impossible to please God"*—this is sobering
- Faith is the door through which we enter relationship with God
- By faith, we believe; in hope, we trust his promises; in love, we respond

**The connection to love:**
- Faith is not the end—it's the beginning
- Faith opens us to receive God's love
- Faith leads to hope, and hope leads to love
- "Faith working through love" (Galatians 5:6)—faith that doesn't lead to love isn't real faith


### Closing (3 minutes)

Faith is saying "yes" to God—yes to his existence, yes to his revelation, yes to his love. It's not a blind leap into the dark; it's a trusting step toward the Light.

The father in Mark's Gospel gives us the perfect prayer: *"I believe; help my unbelief!"* That's where most of us live—somewhere between belief and doubt. And Jesus doesn't reject that. He works with it.

Now we're going to send you to spend time with Jesus in the Sanctuary. As you sit before him in the Blessed Sacrament, bring to him whatever is stirring in your heart about faith—your doubts, your questions, your desire to trust more deeply. Just be with him.

**Let us pray**

> Lord Jesus, you are the Way, the Truth, and the Life. We have heard your call to faith—to trust in you, not just to know about you. Now send us into your presence. As we sit before you in the Blessed Sacrament, help us to bring our doubts, our fears, and our unbelief. Meet us there. Increase our faith. We go now to be with you, the One in whom we place our trust. In your holy name we pray. Amen.

*Please proceed quietly to the Sanctuary.*

### Sins Against Faith (CCC 2089)

The Church identifies specific ways we can sin against faith:
- **Incredulity** — the refusal to believe
- **Heresy** — obstinate, post-baptismal rejection of a doctrine
- **Apostasy** — total rejection of the faith
- **Schism** — refusal to submit to the Roman Pontiff

### How Faith Grows and Weakens

**How faith grows:**
- Prayer—asking God for more faith
- The sacraments—especially Eucharist and Confession
- Scripture and the teaching of the Church
- Community with other believers
- Acting on the faith we have (faith without works is dead)

**How faith weakens:**
- Neglecting prayer and the sacraments
- Surrounding ourselves only with unbelief
- Refusing to act on what we know to be true
- Letting other things become more important than God

### Faith as Spiritual Armor

**Ephesians 6:16 (NABRE):** *"In all circumstances, hold faith as a shield, to quench all the flaming arrows of the evil one."*

Faith is not passive—it's spiritual armor. The enemy attacks with doubt, discouragement, and deception. Faith is our active defense, protecting us from lies that would separate us from God.
