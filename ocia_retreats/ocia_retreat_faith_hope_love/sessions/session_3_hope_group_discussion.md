# Session 3: Hope - Group Discussion (20 minutes)

*Participants return from the Sanctuary to share what God revealed to them during their time with Jesus.*


## Opening Question: What Is God Showing You? (10 minutes)

**"How is God helping you grow in hope today? What revelations or insights did you receive during your time with Jesus?"**

*Facilitator notes:*
- This is the primary question—give it space and time
- Let participants share freely what they experienced in prayer
- Some may have confronted fears; others may have felt peace
- All responses are valid—God works differently in each person
- Listen for themes that emerge across the group


## Follow-Up Questions (if needed, 10 minutes)

*Use these only if the conversation needs prompting:*

**"Think of a time when you felt hopeless—when circumstances seemed impossible. What happened to your relationship with God during that time? Did you draw closer or pull away?"**

*Facilitator notes:*
- This question invites vulnerability about dark times
- Don't rush to "fix" or offer platitudes—let people sit with the reality
- Connect to Romans 5: suffering can produce hope, but it's a process

**"What is one concrete way you could practice hope this week? What would it look like to anchor your soul more firmly in God's promises?"**

*Facilitator notes:*
- Possible answers: praying when anxious instead of worrying, meditating on Scripture promises, trusting God with a specific situation
- This prepares them for the final session on love—hope frees us to love
