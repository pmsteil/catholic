# Session 3: Hope - Trusting in Love's Promise

**Participant Notes**


## Central Truth

> **We hope in God's promise of a share in his glory in Heaven. God's promises are trustworthy. Hope offers to us authentic joy and true courage, and sustains us in times of trial.**


## Key Scripture

**Hebrews 6:19** — *"This we have as an anchor of the soul, sure and firm, which reaches into the interior behind the veil."*

**Romans 5:3-5** — *"Affliction produces endurance, and endurance, proven character, and proven character, hope, and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the holy Spirit."*

**Jeremiah 29:11-13** — *"I know well the plans I have in mind for you—oracle of the LORD—plans for your welfare and not for woe, so as to give you a future of hope. When you call me, and come and pray to me, I will listen to you. When you look for me, you will find me."*

**Romans 8:28** — *"We know that all things work for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose."*

## Lesson Outline

### 1. Hope Is Anchored in God's Promises, Not Our Circumstances

- Hope is an **anchor**—it holds us steady when everything else is shaking

- The progression: suffering → endurance → character → **hope**

- Hope doesn't come *despite* suffering—it often comes **through** suffering

- *"Hope does not disappoint"*—because it's anchored in **God's love**, not circumstances

- The Holy Spirit **pours God's love** into our hearts

**CCC 1817:** *"Hope is the theological virtue by which we desire the kingdom of heaven and eternal life as our happiness, placing our trust in Christ's promises and relying not on our own strength, but on the help of the grace of the Holy Spirit."*

**CCC 1266:** The theological virtues—faith, hope, and love—are *infused* at Baptism. You didn't earn hope. God gave it to you as a gift.

### 2. Hope Gives Us a Reason to Live Differently

- God spoke Jeremiah 29:11 to Israel **in exile**—when everything seemed lost

- Hope is not **denial** of present suffering; it's **confidence** in future redemption

- *"Plans for welfare and not for evil"*—God is **for us**, not against us

- *"You will seek me and find me"*—hope leads to seeking, and seeking leads to finding

- Hope **reorders our priorities**: If Heaven is real, this life is preparation

**What Hope Does:**

- Puts our problems in **perspective**—they're real, but not the end of the story

- Gives us **courage** to face difficulty—we know how the story ends

- Frees us from **despair**—even when things look hopeless, God is working

- Motivates **holiness**—if Heaven is our destination, we want to be ready

**The Beatitudes: Jesus' Roadmap of Hope (Matthew 5:3-12)**

Each beatitude is a promise: *"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."* Hope isn't passive—it shapes how we live *now* because we know where we're going.

### 3. The Enemies of Hope

**Two Sins Against Hope:**

| Sin | What It Is | What It Says |
|-----|------------|--------------|
| **Despair** | Giving up on God's promises | "God can't" or "God won't" |
| **Presumption** | Taking God's promises for granted | "God must" or "God owes me" |

**Despair looks like:**
- Believing your sins are too great to be forgiven
- Believing your situation is beyond God's help
- Believing Heaven isn't real or isn't for you

**Presumption looks like:**
- Assuming you'll be saved without conversion
- Expecting forgiveness without repentance
- Living however you want because "God is merciful"

**CCC 2091:** *"Despair... is contrary to God's goodness, to his justice—for the Lord is faithful to his promises—and to his mercy."*

**Hope walks the middle path:** trusting God's mercy while taking his justice seriously.

**Purgatory: A Sign of Hope**

Purgatory gives us hope. Why? Because it shows us how much God wants us to be with him in Heaven. Purgatory isn't punishment—it's purification. Even if we die imperfect (and we all will), God has made a way for us to be made ready for Heaven. That's hope.

**Hope Fosters Prayer (CCC 2657)**

Hope and prayer go together. When we hope, we pray. When we pray, our hope grows.

## Key Takeaway

Hope is what **gets us through**. When the diagnosis is bad, when the relationship is broken, when the future is uncertain—hope says:

*"God is faithful. He keeps his promises. This is not the end."*

**1 Thessalonians 5:8:** *"But since we are of the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love and the helmet that is hope for salvation."*

Hope is our **helmet**—it protects our minds from despair and presumption.
