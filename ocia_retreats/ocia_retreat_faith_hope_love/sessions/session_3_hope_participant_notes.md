# Session 3: Hope - Trusting in Love's Promise

**Participant Notes**


## Central Truth

> **We hope in God's promise of a share in his glory in Heaven. God's promises are trustworthy. Hope offers to us authentic joy and true courage, and sustains us in times of trial.**


## Key Scripture

**Romans 5:3-5** — *"Affliction produces endurance, and endurance, proven character, and proven character, hope, and hope does not disappoint."*

**Jeremiah 29:11** — *"I know well the plans I have in mind for you... plans for your welfare and not for woe, so as to give you a future of hope."*

**Romans 8:28** — *"We know that all things work for good for those who love God."*


## Lesson Outline

### 1. Hope Is Anchored in God's Promises, Not Our Circumstances

- The progression: suffering → endurance → character → **hope**

- Hope doesn't come *despite* suffering—it often comes **through** suffering

- *"Hope does not disappoint"*—because it's anchored in **God's love**, not circumstances

- The Holy Spirit **pours God's love** into our hearts

**CCC 1817:** *"Hope is the theological virtue by which we desire the kingdom of heaven and eternal life as our happiness, placing our trust in Christ's promises and relying not on our own strength, but on the help of the grace of the Holy Spirit."*

### 2. Hope Gives Us a Reason to Live Differently

- God spoke Jeremiah 29:11 to Israel **in exile**—when everything seemed lost

- Hope is not **denial** of present suffering; it's **confidence** in future redemption

- *"Plans for welfare and not for evil"*—God is **for us**, not against us

- Hope **reorders our priorities**: If Heaven is real, this life is preparation

**What Hope Does:**

- Puts our problems in **perspective**—they're real, but not the end of the story

- Gives us **courage** to face difficulty—we know how the story ends

- Frees us from **despair**—even when things look hopeless, God is working

- Motivates **holiness**—if Heaven is our destination, we want to be ready

### 3. The Enemies of Hope

**Two Sins Against Hope:**

| Sin | What It Is | What It Says |
|-----|------------|--------------|
| **Despair** | Giving up on God's promises | "God can't" or "God won't" |
| **Presumption** | Taking God's promises for granted | "God must" or "God owes me" |

**Despair looks like:**
- Believing your sins are too great to be forgiven
- Believing your situation is beyond God's help
- Believing Heaven isn't real or isn't for you

**Presumption looks like:**
- Assuming you'll be saved without conversion
- Expecting forgiveness without repentance
- Living however you want because "God is merciful"

**CCC 2091:** *"Despair... is contrary to God's goodness, to his justice—for the Lord is faithful to his promises—and to his mercy."*

## Key Takeaway

Hope is what **gets us through**. When the diagnosis is bad, when the relationship is broken, when the future is uncertain—hope says:

*"God is faithful. He keeps his promises. This is not the end."*
