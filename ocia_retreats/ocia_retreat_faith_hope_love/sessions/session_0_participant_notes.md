# Session 0: Opening Foundation - Participant Notes


## What Is a Virtue?

> **"So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love."**
> — 1 Corinthians 13:13 (NABRE)

**CCC 1803:** *"A virtue is an habitual and firm disposition to do the good. It allows the person not only to perform good acts, but to give the best of himself."*


## Two Kinds of Virtue

**1. Human Virtues**
- Cardinal Virtues: Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, Temperance
- Other Human Virtues: Patience, Humility, Chastity, Generosity, Kindness, Gratitude, Honesty, Compassion
- Can be acquired through human effort and practice
- Reach full perfection only when animated by grace and the theological virtues
- Rooted in the theological virtues (CCC 1812)

**2. Theological Virtues**
- Faith, Hope, and Love (Charity)
- *Infused* by God into our souls—He is their author and source
- Enable us to love God and neighbor
- We receive them, cooperate with them, and grow in them through grace


## Why "Theological"? (CCC 1812)

**1. God is their ORIGIN**
- God infuses them directly into our souls
- We don't obtain them through willpower—they are pure gift

**2. God is their OBJECT**
- Faith believes *in God*
- Hope trusts *in God's promises*
- Love loves *God* above all else

**3. God is their MOTIVE**
- We practice them *because of who God is*
- Not to earn rewards or avoid punishment

**CCC 1813:** *"The theological virtues are the foundation of Christian moral activity; they animate it and give it its special character. They inform and give life to all the moral virtues. They are infused by God into the souls of the faithful to make them capable of acting as his children and of meriting eternal life."*


## The Pattern

**God acts first. We respond.**


## Why These Three?

> **1 Corinthians 13:13 (NABRE):**
> *"So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love."*

- **Faith** will become sight
- **Hope** will become possession
- **Love** will remain forever, because God IS Love


## Why We Start with Grace

**Without grace, the theological virtues are impossible.**
