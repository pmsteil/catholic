## Part 1: Teaching (30 minutes)

### Central Truth
> **God gives his own life and friendship to us. We call this gift grace. We do not earn or deserve God's grace. Grace allows us to become God's adopted children and to respond to his abundant love.**

---

### Opening (3 minutes)

Begin with this question to the group: *"Have you ever received a gift so extravagant, so undeserved, that you didn't know how to respond?"*

That's what we're talking about today. Grace is God giving us *himself*—not just blessings, not just help, but his very life.

---

### Talking Point 1: What Grace Actually Is (8 minutes)

**Primary Scripture: Ephesians 2:4-10 (NABRE)**

> *"But God, who is rich in mercy, because of the great love he had for us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, brought us to life with Christ (by grace you have been saved), raised us up with him, and seated us with him in the heavens in Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not from you; it is the gift of God; it is not from works, so no one may boast. For we are his handiwork, created in Christ Jesus for the good works that God has prepared in advance, that we should live in them."*

**Key points to emphasize:**
- Grace is not a thing—it's God's own divine life shared with us
- We were *dead* in sin. Dead people can't save themselves. God made us alive.
- This is pure gift. We didn't earn it. We can't earn it. We can only receive it.
- Grace makes us God's adopted children—not servants, not employees, but *sons and daughters*

**CCC 1996:** *"Grace is favor, the free and undeserved help that God gives us to respond to his call to become children of God."*

### Talking Point 2: How Grace Works in Us (8 minutes)

**Primary Scripture: John 15:1-5 (NABRE)**

> *"I am the true vine, and my Father is the vine grower. He takes away every branch in me that does not bear fruit, and every one that does he prunes so that it bears more fruit. You are already pruned because of the word that I spoke to you. Remain in me, as I remain in you. Just as a branch cannot bear fruit on its own unless it remains on the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in me. I am the vine, you are the branches. Whoever remains in me and I in him will bear much fruit, because without me you can do nothing."*

**Key points to emphasize:**
- Grace isn't just a one-time gift at Baptism—it's an ongoing relationship
- Like a branch connected to the vine, we receive life continuously from Christ
- *"Apart from me you can do nothing"*—this is humbling but also liberating
- The sacraments are the primary channels through which grace flows to us
- We can cooperate with grace or resist it—God respects our freedom

**Two kinds of grace:**
1. **Sanctifying grace** — God's life dwelling in us (received at Baptism, restored in Confession)
2. **Actual grace** — God's help in specific moments to do good and avoid evil

### Talking Point 3: Why This Changes Everything (8 minutes)

**Primary Scripture: 2 Corinthians 12:9 (NABRE)**

> *"But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.' I will rather boast most gladly of my weaknesses, in order that the power of Christ may dwell with me."*

**Key points to emphasize:**
- St. Paul begged God three times to remove his "thorn in the flesh"
- God's answer: *"My grace is sufficient."* Not "I'll fix your problem" but "I am enough."
- This means: In your weakness, in your struggle, in your failure—God's grace is enough
- Grace transforms us from the inside out—new intellect, new will, new capacity to love
- We become capable of things we could never do on our own

**The stakes:**
- Sanctifying grace can be lost through mortal sin
- It is restored through the Sacrament of Reconciliation
- We increase in grace by prayer, the sacraments, and acts of love

---

### Closing (3 minutes)

Grace is the foundation of everything else we'll discuss today. Faith, hope, and love are only possible because God first gives us his grace.

The question isn't "Am I good enough for God?" The question is "Will I receive what God is offering?"

*Transition to discussion...*

---

## Part 2: Group Discussion (30 minutes)

*Allow approximately 10 minutes per question. These questions are designed to help participants recognize their need for God's grace and begin to open themselves to receive it.*

---

### Question 1: Recognizing Our Need (10 minutes)

**"Think of a time when you tried to change something about yourself—a habit, a pattern, a relationship—through sheer willpower alone. What happened? What does this tell you about your need for something beyond your own strength?"**

*Facilitator notes:*
- Let people share honestly about failure—this isn't about shame, it's about truth
- Guide toward the realization that lasting transformation requires more than human effort
- Connect their experience to Paul's words: "Apart from me you can do nothing"
- The goal is not discouragement but honest recognition of our need

---

### Question 2: Receiving vs. Earning (10 minutes)

**"Many of us were raised to believe we have to earn everything we get. How does the idea that God's grace is completely free—that you cannot earn it and don't deserve it—make you feel? Does it bring relief? Discomfort? Why?"**

*Facilitator notes:*
- This question often surfaces deep-seated beliefs about worthiness
- Some may feel relief ("I don't have to be perfect")
- Others may feel uncomfortable ("If I can't earn it, how do I know I have it?")
- Guide toward understanding that receiving a gift requires humility, not achievement
- Connect to the reality that love cannot be earned—only received

---

### Question 3: Opening to Grace (10 minutes)

**"Jesus said his grace is 'sufficient'—enough. Where in your life right now do you most need to hear that God's grace is enough? What would it look like to actually believe that?"**

*Facilitator notes:*
- This question moves from concept to personal application
- Encourage specificity—not "my life in general" but "this relationship," "this struggle," "this fear"
- What would change if they truly believed grace was sufficient?
- How might they live differently starting today?
- This prepares them for the prayer time that follows

---

## Part 3: Prayer with Jesus (15 minutes)

*In the Sanctuary, before the Blessed Sacrament*

Guide participants to:
1. Sit quietly in the presence of Jesus
2. Bring to him the area of life they identified in Question 3
3. Simply ask: "Lord, help me receive your grace"
4. Rest in silence, trusting that he hears

*Close with the Prayer for Grace:*

> Lord Jesus, I cannot save myself. I cannot transform myself. I cannot earn your love. But I can receive it. Open my heart to your grace. Help me to stop striving and start receiving. Let your life flow into me like sap into a branch. Apart from you, I can do nothing. With you, all things are possible. Amen.
