# Session 1: Grace - God's Gift of Himself

**Participant Notes**


## Central Truth

> **God gives his own life and friendship to us. We call this gift grace. We do not earn or deserve God's grace. Grace allows us to become God's adopted children and to respond to his abundant love.**


## Key Scripture

**Ephesians 2:4-10** — *"But God, who is rich in mercy, because of the great love he had for us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, brought us to life with Christ (by grace you have been saved)... For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not from you; it is the gift of God."*

**John 15:5** — *"I am the vine, you are the branches. Whoever remains in me and I in him will bear much fruit, because without me you can do nothing."*

**2 Corinthians 12:9** — *"My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness."*


## Lesson Outline

### 1. What Grace Actually Is

- Grace is not a thing—it's **God's own divine life** shared with us

- In the beginning, God created us and endowed us with grace—but it was **lost by Adam's sin** (original sin)

- We were *dead* in sin—dead people can't save themselves

- Jesus came to **restore God's grace** to us; we receive all grace by the merit of his Paschal mystery (death and resurrection)

- Grace is **pure gift**—we can't earn it, only receive it

- Grace makes us **God's adopted children**—not servants, not employees, but *sons and daughters*

**CCC 1996:** *"Grace is favor, the free and undeserved help that God gives us to respond to his call to become children of God."*

### 2. How Grace Works in Us

- Grace isn't just a one-time gift—it's an **ongoing relationship**

- Like a branch connected to the vine, we receive life **continuously** from Christ

- *"Apart from me you can do nothing"*—this is humbling but also **liberating**

- The sacraments are the **primary channels** through which grace flows

- We can **cooperate** with grace or **resist** it—God respects our freedom

**Key Catholic Terms on Grace:**

| Type | What It Is |
|------|------------|
| **Sanctifying Grace** | God's life dwelling permanently in us; makes us holy (CCC 1999-2000) |
| **Actual Grace** | God's help in specific moments to do good and avoid evil (CCC 2000) |
| **Sacramental Grace** | The particular grace proper to each sacrament (CCC 1129) |
| **Charism** | Special gifts of the Holy Spirit for building up the Church (CCC 799-801) |
| **Justification** | The Holy Spirit's action making us holy; sins truly forgiven (CCC 1987-1995) |
| **Graces of State** | Special graces for our particular vocation (CCC 2004) |

### 3. Why This Changes Everything

- St. Paul begged God three times to remove his "thorn in the flesh"

- God's answer: *"My grace is sufficient"*—not "I'll fix your problem" but **"I am enough"**

- Grace transforms us **from the inside out**—new intellect, new will, new capacity to love

- We become capable of things we could **never do on our own**

**The Stakes:**

- Sanctifying grace can be **lost** through mortal sin

- It is **restored** through the Sacrament of Reconciliation

- We **increase** in grace by prayer, the sacraments, and acts of love

**What Grace Does in Us:**

- **Transforms our intellect and will** — We are empowered to know and love in a new way

- **Makes us members of the Body of Christ** — We belong to the Church, connected to all believers

- **Gives us the Gifts of the Holy Spirit** — Wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, fear of the Lord

- **Produces the Fruits of the Spirit** — Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control (Galatians 5:22-23)

## Key Takeaway

Grace is the **foundation** of everything else. Faith, hope, and love are only possible because God **first gives us his grace**.

The question isn't *"Am I good enough for God?"*

The question is *"Will I receive what God is offering?"*

## Prayer for Grace

> Lord Jesus, I cannot save myself. I cannot transform myself. I cannot earn your love. But I can receive it. Open my heart to your grace. Help me to stop striving and start receiving. Apart from you, I can do nothing. With you, all things are possible. **Amen.**
