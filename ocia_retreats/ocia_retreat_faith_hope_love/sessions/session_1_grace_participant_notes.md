# Session 1: Grace - God's Gift of Himself

**Participant Notes**

---

## Central Truth

> **God gives his own life and friendship to us. We call this gift grace. We do not earn or deserve God's grace. Grace allows us to become God's adopted children and to respond to his abundant love.**

---

## Key Scripture

**Ephesians 2:4-10** — *"By grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not from you; it is the gift of God."*

**John 15:5** — *"I am the vine, you are the branches... apart from me you can do nothing."*

**2 Corinthians 12:9** — *"My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness."*

## Lesson Outline

### 1. What Grace Actually Is

- Grace is not a thing—it's **God's own divine life** shared with us

- We were dead in sin—dead people can't save themselves

- Grace is **pure gift**—we can't earn it, only receive it

- Grace makes us **God's adopted children**

**CCC 1996:** *"Grace is favor, the free and undeserved help that God gives us to respond to his call to become children of God."*

### 2. How Grace Works in Us

- Grace isn't just a one-time gift—it's an **ongoing relationship**

- Like a branch connected to the vine, we receive life **continuously** from Christ

- The sacraments are the **primary channels** through which grace flows

- We can **cooperate** with grace or **resist** it—God respects our freedom

**Two Kinds of Grace:**

| Type | What It Is |
|------|------------|
| **Sanctifying Grace** | God's life dwelling in us (received at Baptism, restored in Confession) |
| **Actual Grace** | God's help in specific moments to do good and avoid evil |

### 3. Why This Changes Everything

- St. Paul begged God to remove his "thorn in the flesh"

- God's answer: *"My grace is sufficient"*—not "I'll fix your problem" but **"I am enough"**

- Grace transforms us **from the inside out**

- We become capable of things we could **never do on our own**

**The Stakes:**

- Sanctifying grace can be **lost** through mortal sin

- It is **restored** through the Sacrament of Reconciliation

- We **increase** in grace by prayer, the sacraments, and acts of love

## Key Takeaway

Grace is the **foundation** of everything else. Faith, hope, and love are only possible because God **first gives us his grace**.

The question isn't *"Am I good enough for God?"*

The question is *"Will I receive what God's gift of His self?"*

## Prayer for Grace

> Lord Jesus, I cannot save myself. I cannot transform myself. I cannot earn your love. But I can receive it. Open my heart to your grace. Help me to stop striving and start receiving. Apart from you, I can do nothing. With you, all things are possible. **Amen.**
