# Session 3 Devotional: Anchored in Hope

**15 Minutes with Jesus**

---

> *"Hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the holy Spirit that has been given to us."*
> — Romans 5:5 (NABRE)

## The Anchor That Holds

Life is hard. You know this.

You have learned that God exists—and that evil and suffering are real. You have seen how God's answer to suffering is love: truth, justice, and mercy woven together. You have traced His covenant faithfulness through history, even when His people failed Him again and again.

God does not abandon. God keeps His promises. This is the foundation of hope.

And yet—there are days when the weight feels unbearable. Anxiety about the future. Grief over the past. Discouragement in the present. The state of the world. The struggles in your own life. Moments when you wonder if things will ever change.

And yet—you are here. You have not given up. Something in you keeps reaching for the light.

That something is hope.

Hope is not optimism. Optimism says, "Things will probably work out." Hope says, "God is faithful, no matter what happens." Optimism depends on circumstances. Hope depends on God.

Jesus said:

> *"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give it to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled or afraid."* (John 14:27, NABRE)

**St. Padre Pio** wrote:

> *"Pray, hope, and don't worry. Worry is useless. God is merciful and will hear your prayer."*

**St. Thomas Aquinas** defined hope this way:

> *"Hope is the theological virtue by which we desire the kingdom of heaven and eternal life as our happiness, placing our trust in Christ's promises and relying not on our own strength, but on the help of the grace of the Holy Spirit."*

Notice: hope relies *not on our own strength*. This is crucial. Hope is not about being strong enough to endure. Hope is about trusting a God who is strong enough to carry us.

## Hope Built on Grace and Faith

We have journeyed through grace—God's free gift of Himself. We have said yes in faith—believing that God is who He says He is. Now hope takes us further.

Hope is faith looking forward.

- **Grace** is God giving Himself to us.
- **Faith** is believing that gift is real.
- **Hope** is trusting that God will complete what He has begun.
- **Love** will be living fully in that completion.

**St. Paul** understood this progression when he wrote to the Philippians:

> *"I am confident of this, that the one who began a good work in you will continue to complete it until the day of Christ Jesus."* (Philippians 1:6, NABRE)

God has begun something in you. Hope trusts that He will finish it.

## Reflection Questions

*Sit quietly with Jesus. Let these questions rest in your heart.*

**1. Where in my life am I tempted to despair or discouragement?**

## A Prayer for Hope

*Pray this slowly, from your heart:*

> **Lord Jesus, I am tired.**
>
> I am tired of struggling. Tired of waiting. Tired of wondering if things will ever change.
>
> But I come to You because I believe You are faithful.
> I come to You because Your promises are true.
> I come to You because You are my only hope.
>
> Anchor my soul in You.
> When the storms come, hold me fast.
> When the darkness closes in, be my light.
> When I am tempted to give up, remind me that You never give up on me.
>
> I place my hope in You alone.
>
> **Amen.**

## Traditional Prayer: Act of Hope

*This ancient prayer expresses confident trust in God's promises. Pray it slowly, letting each phrase strengthen your heart.*

> **O my God, relying on your infinite goodness and promises, I hope to obtain pardon of my sins, the help of your grace, and life everlasting, through the merits of Jesus Christ, my Lord and Redeemer.**
>
> **Amen.**

## Rest in His Presence

*Now, set aside this booklet.*

You have reflected. You have prayed. But the most important thing is simply to *be* with Jesus.

He is here—truly present in the Blessed Sacrament before you. You don't need to solve your problems right now. You don't need to feel hopeful. Just rest in the presence of the One who holds your future. Speak to Him from your heart—your fears, your weariness, your longing for something more. Or simply be still and let His peace wash over you.

**Remain here in silence until the bell rings.**

When you hear the bell, pray the closing prayer below, then return quietly to the Parish Hall.

## Closing Prayer: The Anima Christi

*Ask Christ to anchor your hope as you pray:*

> **Soul of Christ, sanctify me.**
> Body of Christ, save me.
> Blood of Christ, inebriate me.
> Water from the side of Christ, wash me.
> Passion of Christ, strengthen me.
> O good Jesus, hear me.
> Within your wounds, hide me.
> Permit me not to be separated from you.
> From the wicked foe, defend me.
> At the hour of my death, call me
> and bid me come to you,
> that with your saints I may praise you
> forever and ever.
> **Amen.**

*We do not walk this journey alone. The saints who have gone before us intercede for us. Ask for their prayers:*

> Holy Mary, Mother of Hope, **pray for us.**
>
> St. John Paul II, our parish patron, **pray for us.**
>
> St. Padre Pio, **pray for us.**
>
> St. Thomas Aquinas, **pray for us.**
>
> All holy men and women, **pray for us.**

## As You Leave

*While making the Sign of the Cross, pray:*

> **In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.**
>
> **Lord, I place my hope in You.**
> **Amen.**

You are not alone. You have never been alone. The God who began a good work in you will be faithful to complete it.

Go in peace. The journey continues.

*"For I know well the plans I have in mind for you—oracle of the LORD—plans for your welfare and not for woe, so as to give you a future of hope."*
