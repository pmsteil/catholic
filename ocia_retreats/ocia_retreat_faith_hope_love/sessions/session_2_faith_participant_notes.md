# Session 2: Faith - Believing in Love

**Participant Notes**

---

## Central Truth

> **We believe because of the authority of God who reveals. Our response is a gift of his grace. We must remain steadfast in faith to see God.**

---

## Key Scripture

**John 14:6** — *"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."*

**Mark 9:24** — *"I do believe, help my unbelief!"*

**Hebrews 11:1, 6** — *"Faith is the realization of what is hoped for and evidence of things not seen... without faith it is impossible to please him."*

## Lesson Outline

### 1. Faith Is Personal Trust, Not Just Information

- Jesus doesn't say "believe these facts about me"—he says **"believe IN me"**

- Faith is **personal trust** in a Person, not just intellectual agreement

- *"Let not your hearts be troubled"*—faith brings **peace**, not anxiety

- Jesus claims to be **THE way**—not A way

**CCC 1814:** *"Faith is the theological virtue by which we believe in God and believe all that he has said and revealed to us... because he is truth itself."*

### 2. Faith Is a Gift We Must Choose to Receive

- The father's prayer: *"I believe; help my unbelief!"*—the most **honest** prayer

- Faith is a **gift from God**—we can't manufacture it

- But we must **choose** to receive it and cooperate with it

- **Doubt** is not the opposite of faith—**refusal** is the opposite of faith

**How Faith Grows:**
- Prayer—asking God for more faith
- The sacraments—especially Eucharist and Confession
- Scripture and the teaching of the Church
- Community with other believers
- Acting on the faith we have

**How Faith Weakens:**
- Neglecting prayer and the sacraments
- Surrounding ourselves only with unbelief
- Refusing to act on what we know to be true
- Letting other things become more important than God

### 3. Faith Is the Foundation for Everything Else

- Faith is **assurance** and **conviction**—not wishful thinking

- We believe in things we cannot see—but that doesn't mean they're **not real**

- *"Without faith it is impossible to please God"*—this is sobering

- Faith is the **door** through which we enter relationship with God

**The Connection to Love:**

- Faith is not the end—it's the **beginning**

- Faith opens us to **receive** God's love

- Faith leads to hope, and hope leads to love

- *"Faith working through love"* (Galatians 5:6)

## Key Takeaway

Faith is saying **"yes"** to God—yes to his existence, yes to his revelation, yes to his love.

It's not a blind leap into the dark; it's a **trusting step toward the Light**.

## Act of Faith

> O my God, I firmly believe that you are one God in three divine Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. I believe that your divine Son became man and died for our sins, and that he will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe these and all the truths which the holy Catholic Church teaches, because you have revealed them, who can neither deceive nor be deceived. **Amen.**
