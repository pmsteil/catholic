# Session 2: Faith - Believing in Love

**Participant Notes**


## Central Truth

> **We believe because God, the Author of Creation, reality, truth, love reveals all that is true, good, and beautiful. Our response is a gift of his grace. We must remain steadfast in faith to see God.**


## Key Scripture

**John 14:6** — *"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."*

**Mark 9:24** — *"I do believe, help my unbelief!"*

**Hebrews 11:1, 6** — *"Faith is the realization of what is hoped for and evidence of things not seen... without faith it is impossible to please him, for anyone who approaches God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him."*


## Lesson Outline

### 1. Faith Is Personal Trust, Not Just Information

- When you hear the word "faith"—think **"trust in Jesus"**

- The Greek word for faith (*pistis*) always orbits around **trust**

- Jesus doesn't say "trust these facts about me"—he says **"trust IN me"**

- Jesus claims to be **THE way**—not A way. This is exclusive, but it's also an invitation.

- Faith is trust in His Grace—trusting the **Author of all that is true**

**CCC 1814:** *"Faith is the theological virtue by which we believe in God and believe all that he has said and revealed to us, and that Holy Church proposes for our belief, because he is truth itself."*

**CCC 1815:** *"The gift of faith remains in one who has not sinned against it. But 'faith apart from works is dead': when it is deprived of hope and love, faith does not fully unite the believer to Christ."*

**Faith and reason work together:** Faith does not oppose reason. God is the source of both, so they can never truly contradict each other (CCC 35).

### 2. Faith Is a Gift We Must Choose to Receive

- The father's prayer: *"I believe; help my unbelief!"*—the most **honest** prayer

- Faith is a **gift from God**—we can't manufacture it

- But we must **choose** to receive it and cooperate with it

- **Doubt** is not the opposite of faith—**refusal** is the opposite of faith

- Faith grows through prayer, sacraments, Scripture, community, and acting on what we believe

- Faith weakens when we neglect these things

### 3. Faith Is the Foundation for Everything Else

- Faith is **assurance** and **conviction**—not wishful thinking

- We believe in things we cannot see—but that doesn't mean they're **not real**

- *"Without faith it is impossible to please God"*—this is sobering

- Faith is the **door** through which we enter relationship with God

**The Connection to Love:**

- Faith is not the end—it's the **beginning**

- Faith opens us to **receive** God's love

- Faith leads to hope, and hope leads to love

- *"Faith working through love"* (Galatians 5:6)—faith that doesn't lead to love isn't real faith

## Key Takeaway

Faith is saying **"yes"** to God—yes to his existence, yes to his revelation, yes to his love.

It's not a blind leap into the dark; it's a **trusting step toward the Light**.


## My Response

*One thing I want to remember about this lesson:*

## Act of Faith

> O my God, I firmly believe that you are one God in three divine Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. I believe that your divine Son became man and died for our sins, and that he will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe these and all the truths which the holy Catholic Church teaches, because you have revealed them, who can neither deceive nor be deceived. **Amen.**
