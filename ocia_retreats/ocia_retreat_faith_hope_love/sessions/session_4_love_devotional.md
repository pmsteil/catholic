## The Destination of the Journey

You have traveled far—not just today, but throughout your entire OCIA journey.

You learned that God exists and that the solution to evil and suffering is love. You discovered that love is not a feeling but a reality that binds truth, justice, and mercy together. You met the Trinity—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—an eternal communion of love. You traced God's covenant plan, saw it fulfilled in Jesus Christ, and found it alive in the Church, the Mass, the sacraments.

Everything you have learned has been pointing here. To love.

Today you began with grace—the overwhelming gift of God pouring out His very life toward you. You responded with faith—saying yes to a God who reveals Himself. You anchored yourself in hope—trusting that God will complete what He has begun.

Now you arrive at the destination: Love.

But here is the beautiful truth—love is not just the destination. Love has been with you all along. Grace *is* love reaching out. Faith *is* love received. Hope *is* love trusted. And now, love calls you to *remain*.

**St. John** understood this when he wrote:

> *"In this is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as expiation for our sins."* (1 John 4:10, NABRE)

Love begins with God. Always. You are not here to earn God's love. You are here to receive it, to rest in it, and to let it transform you.

## God IS Love

St. Paul wrote that faith, hope, and love abide—but *the greatest of these is love* (1 Corinthians 13:13).

Why is love the greatest?

Because love is who God *is*. Not just what God does—who God *is*. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are an eternal communion of self-giving love. And this love—this very love—has been pursuing you your entire life. Before you knew His name. Before you walked through the doors of this parish. Before you took your first breath. God's love was there.

**St. Augustine** captured this beautifully:

> *"You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you."*

The restlessness you have felt—the longing, the searching, the ache for something more—that is your heart seeking the love it was made for. And that love is here. That love is now. That love is Jesus, present before you.

## Called to Be Love in the World

But God does not call you simply to receive His love. He calls you to *become* His love in the world.

The prophet Micah asked what the Lord requires of us. The answer echoes through the ages:

> *"You have been told, O mortal, what is good, and what the LORD requires of you: Only to do justice and to love goodness, and to walk humbly with your God."* (Micah 6:8, NABRE)

This is your calling. This is why you are here. Not just to know about God's love, but to *be* God's love—to bear truth in a world drowning in lies, to do justice where injustice reigns, to love mercy when the world demands vengeance, and to walk humbly with your God every step of the way.

Jesus gave everything for you. Now He invites you to give your whole life to Him.

**St. John of the Cross** wrote:

> *"In the evening of life, we will be judged on love alone."*

Not on how much we knew. Not on how much we accomplished. Not on how impressive our faith appeared. On love. Only love.

## The Next Generation

Look around you. The world is dark. But you—*you*—are called to be light.

Jesus said:

> *"You are the light of the world. A city set on a mountain cannot be hidden."* (Matthew 5:14, NABRE)

You are the next generation that brings light into the darkness. You are the ones who will carry the faith forward. You are the hands and feet of Christ in a world that desperately needs to see His love made visible.

This is not a burden. This is a gift. This is the adventure you were made for.

## Reflection Questions

## A Prayer of Total Surrender

*Pray this slowly, from your heart:*

> **Lord Jesus, You are Love.**
>
> You loved me before I knew You.
> You loved me when I ran from You.
> You love me now, in all my weakness and failure.
>
> I give You my whole life.
> Not part of it. Not the easy parts. All of it.
> As You gave Yourself completely for me, I give myself completely to You.
>
> Make me Your love in the world.
> Send me to bear truth where there are lies.
> Send me to do justice where there is oppression.
> Send me to love mercy where there is cruelty.
> Teach me to walk humbly with You every day.
>
> I am Yours. Use me. Send me. I am ready.
>
> *"You have been told, O mortal, what is good, and what the LORD requires of you: Only to do justice and to love goodness, and to walk humbly with your God."* (Micah 6:8)
>
> **Amen.**

## Traditional Prayer: Act of Love

*This ancient prayer expresses the heart of charity—loving God above all and neighbor for God's sake. Pray it slowly, letting each phrase become your own.*

> **O my God, I love you above all things, with my whole heart and soul, because you are all good and worthy of all my love.**
>
> **I love my neighbor as myself for the love of you.**
>
> **I forgive all who have injured me, and I ask pardon of all whom I have injured.**
>
> **Amen.**

## Closing Prayer: The Anima Christi

*Ask Christ to fill you with His love as you pray:*

> **Soul of Christ, sanctify me.**
> Body of Christ, save me.
> Blood of Christ, inebriate me.
> Water from the side of Christ, wash me.
> Passion of Christ, strengthen me.
> O good Jesus, hear me.
> Within your wounds, hide me.
> Permit me not to be separated from you.
> From the wicked foe, defend me.
> At the hour of my death, call me
> and bid me come to you,
> that with your saints I may praise you
> forever and ever.
> **Amen.**

*We do not walk this journey alone. The saints who have gone before us intercede for us. Ask for their prayers:*

> Holy Mary, Queen of Heaven, **pray for us.**
>
> St. John Paul II, our parish patron, **pray for us.**
>
> St. Augustine, **pray for us.**
>
> St. John of the Cross, **pray for us.**
>
> All holy men and women, **pray for us.**

## As You Leave

*While making the Sign of the Cross, pray:*

> **In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.**
>
> **Lord, help me to love as You love.**
> **Amen.**

You have received grace. You have said yes in faith. You have anchored yourself in hope. Now go and love—for love is why you were made.

Go in peace. The journey continues—and love leads the way.

*"Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God; everyone who loves is begotten by God and knows God."*
