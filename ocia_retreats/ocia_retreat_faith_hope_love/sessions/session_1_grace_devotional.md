# Session 1 Devotional: Resting in God's Grace

**15 Minutes with Jesus**

> *"But God, who is rich in mercy, because of the great love he had for us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, brought us to life with Christ."*
> — Ephesians 2:4-5 (NABRE)

## The Gift You Cannot Earn

You are sitting in the midst of Love Himself.

The God who created the universe—who holds every star in place, who knows every hair on your head—is here. And He is not here to judge you, to fix you, or to demand something from you. He is here to give Himself to you.

This is grace.

You have learned that God exists, that He is Trinity—a communion of love. You have seen His covenant plan unfold through history, culminating in Jesus Christ. You have discovered the Church, the sacraments, the Mass. You know *about* God.

But grace is how you come to know God *personally*. Grace is not a thing God gives. Grace is God giving *Himself*. Right now, in this moment, the infinite God is pouring out His divine life toward you—not because you've earned it, not because you deserve it, but simply because He loves you.

**St. Thérèse of Lisieux** understood this when she wrote:

> *"It is not because I have been preserved from mortal sin that I lift up my heart to God in trust and love. I feel that even if I had on my conscience every crime one could commit, I would lose nothing of my confidence. Heartbroken with repentance, I would simply throw myself into my Savior's arms."*

Can you receive this? Can you let go of the need to earn, to prove, to be worthy—and simply receive?

## Grace and the Virtues: The Foundation of Everything

Today we begin a journey through the theological virtues: **Faith, Hope, and Love**. But before we can believe, before we can hope, before we can love—we must first receive.

Grace is the foundation.

- **Faith** is possible because grace opens our eyes to see God.
- **Hope** is possible because grace assures us of God's promises.
- **Love** is possible because grace pours God's own love into our hearts.

Without grace, we cannot take a single step toward God. But *with* grace, everything becomes possible.

**St. Augustine**, who knew the depths of his own weakness, wrote:

> *"God does not command the impossible, but in commanding He admonishes you to do what you can, and to ask for what you cannot do, and He helps you so that you can do it."*

You are not alone. You have never been alone. God's grace surrounds you, sustains you, and empowers you for everything He calls you to.

## Reflection Questions

*Sit quietly with Jesus. Let these questions rest in your heart. You don't need to answer them—just let them open you to God's presence.*

---

**1. Where have I been trying to earn God's love?**

What would it mean to stop striving and simply receive?

**2. What weakness am I ashamed of?**

Can I bring it to Jesus right now and hear Him say, "My grace is sufficient for you"?

*My thoughts:*

**3. How is God inviting me to trust Him more deeply?**

Grace is the beginning—faith, hope, and love will follow.

## A Prayer of Surrender

*Pray this slowly, from your heart:*

> **Lord Jesus, I come to You just as I am.**
>
> I have nothing to offer You but my need.
> I cannot earn Your love. I cannot deserve Your grace.
> But I can receive.
>
> Help me to receive.
>
> Open my hands that have been clenched in striving.
> Open my heart that has been closed in shame.
> Open my soul to the flood of Your mercy.
>
> I believe that Your grace is enough.
> I believe that Your love is real.
> I believe that You are here, right now, giving Yourself to me.
>
> Jesus, I trust in You.
>
> **Amen.**

## Rest in His Presence

*Now, set aside this booklet.*

You have reflected. You have prayed. But the most important thing is simply to *be* with Jesus.

He is here—truly present in the Blessed Sacrament before you. You don't need words. You don't need to figure anything out. Just rest in His presence. Let Him look at you with love. Speak to Him from your heart—whatever comes naturally. Or simply be still and know that He is God.

**Remain here in silence until the bell rings.**

When you hear the bell, pray the closing prayer below, then return quietly to the Parish Hall.

## Closing Prayer: The Anima Christi

*This ancient prayer, beloved by St. Ignatius of Loyola, is a perfect way to close your time with Jesus. It asks Christ to sanctify us with His grace—the very gift we have been reflecting on.*

> **Soul of Christ, sanctify me.**
> Body of Christ, save me.
> Blood of Christ, inebriate me.
> Water from the side of Christ, wash me.
> Passion of Christ, strengthen me.
> O good Jesus, hear me.
> Within your wounds, hide me.
> Permit me not to be separated from you.
> From the wicked foe, defend me.
> At the hour of my death, call me
> and bid me come to you,
> that with your saints I may praise you
> forever and ever.
> **Amen.**

*We do not walk this journey alone. The saints who have gone before us intercede for us. Ask for their prayers:*

> Holy Mary, Mother of God, **pray for us.**
>
> St. John Paul II, **pray for us.**
>
> St. Thérèse of Lisieux, **pray for us.**
>
> St. Augustine, **pray for us.**
>
> St. Ignatius of Loyola, **pray for us.**
>
> All holy men and women, **pray for us.**

## As You Leave

*While making the Sign of the Cross, pray:*

> **In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.**
>
> **Thank you, Lord. I receive Your grace.**
> **Amen.**

You don't need to feel anything special. You don't need to have had a profound experience. Grace works whether we feel it or not.

Go in peace. The journey continues.

*"For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not from you; it is the gift of God."*
— Ephesians 2:8 (NABRE)
