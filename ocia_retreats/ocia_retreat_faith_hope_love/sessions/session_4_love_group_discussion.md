# Session 4: Love - Group Discussion (20 minutes)

*Participants return from the Sanctuary to share what God revealed to them during their time with Jesus.*


## Opening Question: What Is God Showing You? (10 minutes)

**"How is God helping you grow in love today? What revelations or insights did you receive during your time with Jesus?"**

*Facilitator notes:*
- This is the primary question—give it space and time
- Let participants share freely what they experienced in prayer
- Some may have felt God's love deeply; others may have been challenged
- All responses are valid—God works differently in each person
- Listen for themes that emerge across the group


## Follow-Up Questions (if needed, 10 minutes)

*Use these only if the conversation needs prompting:*

**"Do you actually believe God loves you? Not in theory, but personally—do you believe God delights in you, wants you, pursues you? What makes it hard to receive that love?"**

*Facilitator notes:*
- This is foundational—we cannot give what we haven't received
- Common obstacles: shame, past failures, feeling unworthy
- Connect to 1 John 4:19: "We love because he first loved us"

**"Based on everything you've heard today, what is one specific way you will choose to love this week—either in receiving God's love more deeply, or in giving love to someone who needs it?"**

*Facilitator notes:*
- This is the decision point of the entire retreat
- Encourage specificity: not "I'll try to be more loving" but "I will call my estranged brother" or "I will spend 10 minutes in prayer each morning receiving God's love"
- This prepares them for the closing session and their return to daily life
