# Session 2: Faith - Group Discussion (20 minutes)

*Participants return from the Sanctuary to share what God revealed to them during their time with Jesus.*


## Opening Question: What Is God Showing You? (10 minutes)

**"How is God helping you grow in faith today? What revelations or insights did you receive during your time with Jesus?"**

*Facilitator notes:*
- This is the primary question—give it space and time
- Let participants share freely what they experienced in prayer
- Some may have wrestled with doubts; others may have felt peace
- All responses are valid—God works differently in each person
- Listen for themes that emerge across the group


## Follow-Up Questions (if needed, 10 minutes)

*Use these only if the conversation needs prompting:*

**"What makes it hard for you to trust God? Is it something from your past? Something you've seen? Something you don't understand?"**

*Facilitator notes:*
- This question invites honesty about obstacles to faith
- Common answers: past hurts, unanswered prayers, suffering in the world
- Don't try to "fix" people's doubts—let them name them
- Connect to the father's prayer: "Help my unbelief"

**"Where in your life is God asking you to act on faith—to do something that requires trusting him even though you can't see the outcome?"**

*Facilitator notes:*
- Encourage specificity: a conversation, a decision, a change, a risk
- What would it look like to take one step of faith this week?
