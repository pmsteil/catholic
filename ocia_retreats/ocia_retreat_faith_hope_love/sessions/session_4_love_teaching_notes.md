## Part 1: Teaching (30 minutes)

### Central Truth
> **Love is the essence of the inner life of the Trinity. It is the soul of holiness and the basis upon which we will be judged. In Heaven, the faithful will live in the joy of perfect love.**


### Opening (3 minutes)

*Connect to the entire retreat:* Everything we've talked about today leads here. Grace is God giving us his life. Faith is saying "yes" to God. Hope is trusting his promises. But love—love is the destination. Love is why God created us. Love is what we were made for.

Ask the group: *"What must I do to inherit eternal life?"*

That's the question a lawyer asked Jesus in Luke 10. And Jesus' answer was: Love. Love God. Love your neighbor. *"Do this, and you will live."*


### Talking Point 1: God IS Love—Not Just That He Loves (8 minutes)

**Primary Scripture: 1 John 4:7-12, 16 (NABRE)**

> *"Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God; everyone who loves is begotten by God and knows God. Whoever is without love does not know God, for God is love. In this way the love of God was revealed to us: God sent his only Son into the world so that we might have life through him. In this is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as expiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also must love one another. No one has ever seen God. Yet, if we love one another, God remains in us, and his love is brought to perfection in us... God is love, and whoever remains in love remains in God and God in him."*

**Key points to emphasize:**
- *"God IS love"*—not just that God loves, but that love is his very nature
- The Trinity is an eternal communion of love: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit giving themselves to each other
- We were created to participate in this love—to receive it and to give it
- *"He who does not love does not know God"*—you cannot know God without loving
- Love is not optional for Christians—it's the very definition of what it means to follow Christ

**CCC 1822:** *"Charity is the theological virtue by which we love God above all things for his own sake, and our neighbor as ourselves for the love of God."*

Notice: We love God *for his own sake*—not for what we get from him. And we love neighbor *for the love of God*—not because they deserve it.

**Important:** The theological virtues—including love—are *infused* by God at Baptism (CCC 1266). We don't earn them; we receive them as gift. They adapt us for participation in God's own nature (CCC 1812). This is why love is not just a nice feeling—it's a supernatural gift that enables us to love as God loves.


### Talking Point 2: Love Is a Command—Which Means It's a Choice (8 minutes)

**Primary Scripture: John 13:34-35; 15:12-13 (NABRE)**

> *"I give you a new commandment: love one another. As I have loved you, so you also should love one another. This is how all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."*

> *"This is my commandment: love one another as I love you. No one has greater love than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends."*

**Key points to emphasize:**
- Jesus *commands* us to love—which means love is an act of the will, not just a feeling
- *"As I have loved you"*—the standard is Christ's love, not human affection
- How did Jesus love? Sacrificially. Unconditionally. To the point of death.
- *"By this all men will know"*—love is the mark of a Christian, the proof of our faith
- Love is not "something to do"—it is the point of all doing

**What love is NOT:**
- Love is not a feeling (though feelings may accompany it)
- Love is not approval of everything someone does
- Love is not being "nice" or avoiding conflict
- Love is not earned or deserved

**What love IS:**
- Willing the good of the other
- Self-gift—giving yourself for the sake of another
- An act of the will that can be commanded and chosen
- The fulfillment of the entire law (Romans 13:10)
- The bond of perfect harmony that holds all virtues together (Colossians 3:14)

**Supporting Scripture: Galatians 5:6 (NABRE)**
> *"For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love."*

Faith and love cannot be separated. A faith that does not express itself in love is not saving faith. As James writes: *"Faith of itself, if it does not have works, is dead"* (James 2:17).

**Why can't faith be separated from love?** Because faith, hope, and all the virtues are all part of the supernatural gift of LOVE!

Think about it this way:
- **Love is the "form" of all the virtues** (CCC 1827)—it gives them their shape and direction
- **Faith** believes in God—but *why* do we believe? Because we love the One who reveals himself
- **Hope** trusts God's promises—but *why* do we trust? Because we love the One who promises
- **Every virtue** is ordered toward love—justice, mercy, patience, kindness—all of them flow from and lead back to love

St. Paul says love is *"the bond of perfection"* (Colossians 3:14)—it's the glue that holds all the virtues together. Without love, the other virtues fall apart. With love, they become a unified whole.

This is why the Church teaches that **charity is the soul of holiness** (CCC 826). You can have faith and hope without charity (as in mortal sin), but they cannot save you—they're like a body without a soul. Love is what animates everything else.

So when we talk about growing in faith, hope, or any virtue—we're really talking about growing in love. It's all one gift, and that gift is participation in God's own life—because *God IS love*.


### Talking Point 3: The Final Test—Love in Action (8 minutes)

**Primary Scripture: Matthew 25:31-40 (NABRE)**

> *"When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit upon his glorious throne, and all the nations will be assembled before him. And he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. Then the king will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, a stranger and you welcomed me, naked and you clothed me, ill and you cared for me, in prison and you visited me.' Then the righteous will answer him and say, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? When did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? When did we see you ill or in prison, and visit you?' And the king will say to them in reply, 'Amen, I say to you, whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me.'"*

**Key points to emphasize:**
- This is the "final test"—the basis on which we will be judged
- Notice: Jesus doesn't ask about our theology or our feelings. He asks about our actions.
- *"As you did it to one of the least of these, you did it to me"*—Jesus identifies with the poor, the suffering, the forgotten
- Love must be concrete—it must take action
- Faith and hope prepare us for love; love is the destination

**CCC 1826:** *"If I... have not charity, I am nothing... Charity is superior to all the virtues. It is the first of the theological virtues."*

**The sins against love (CCC 2093-2094):**
- **Indifference**—not caring about God's love or the needs of others
- **Ingratitude**—taking God's love for granted, failing to give thanks
- **Lukewarmness**—half-hearted response to God's love
- **Acedia** (spiritual sloth)—refusing to engage with God's love; spiritual laziness
- **Hatred**—the direct opposite of love, wishing evil upon God or neighbor

**How sin affects love:**
- **Mortal sin** destroys charity in the heart—it kills love, even when faith and hope remain
- **Venial sin** wounds charity—it weakens our love but does not destroy it
- This is why we need the Sacrament of Reconciliation—to restore and heal our capacity to love

**Love and the Sacraments:**
- The **Eucharist** is the "Sacrament of Love"—Jesus stays with us because of love
- **Confession** restores our broken fellowship with the Father when sin has wounded or destroyed love
- Through the sacraments, God's love is poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit (Romans 5:5)


**Love and Prayer (CCC 2658):**
Love is both the *source* of prayer and the *heights* of prayer. We pray because we love God. And the more we pray, the more we grow in love. Prayer and love feed each other.

**Love and Justice (CCC 1889):**
It is charity that enables us to act justly. Without love, we cannot give others what they are owed. Love is not opposed to justice—love *enables* justice.

### Closing (3 minutes)

Here's the truth we've been building toward all day:

- **Grace** is God giving us his life—so that we can love
- **Faith** is saying "yes" to God—so that we can receive his love
- **Hope** is trusting God's promises—so that we're freed to love without fear
- **Love** is the destination—participating in the very life of the Trinity

The question isn't "Do you feel loving?" The question is "Will you choose to love?"

Jesus said: *"By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."*

Not by your knowledge. Not by your attendance. Not by your feelings. By your love.

Now we're going to send you to spend time with Jesus in the Sanctuary. As you sit before him in the Blessed Sacrament—Love Incarnate—bring to him whatever is stirring in your heart. Ask him to help you receive his love and to love as he loves. Just be with him.

**Let us pray**

> Lord Jesus, you are Love Incarnate—God who IS love, made visible in human flesh. We have heard your command to love as you have loved us. Now send us into your presence. As we sit before you in the Blessed Sacrament, help us first to receive your love, so that we may have love to give. Soften our hearts toward those we find hard to love. Set us on fire with the love that casts out fear. We go now to be with the One who loved us to the end. In your holy name we pray. Amen.

*Please proceed quietly to the Sanctuary.*
