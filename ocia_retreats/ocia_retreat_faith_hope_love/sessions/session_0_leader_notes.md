# Session 0: Opening Foundation - Leader Notes

**Time:** 8:00 AM - 8:25 AM (25 minutes)
**Location:** Parish Hall


## Purpose of This Session

This opening session accomplishes three essential goals:
1. **Orient** participants to the day's schedule and rhythm
2. **Establish** the theological foundation (virtue, theological virtue, grace)
3. **Invite** participants into an encounter with Jesus, not just information about Jesus


## Part 1: Welcome and Schedule Overview (8 minutes)

### Welcome (2 minutes)

**Sign of the Cross**

**Opening Prayer:**

*Heavenly Father, we ask Your blessing over this entire day and over all of us gathered here. Send Your Holy Spirit upon us, that we may encounter You more deeply in Your perfect and all-loving Grace. Help us grow in faith, in hope, and most importantly, Lord, in Your love. Mary, Mother of the Church, pray for us as we begin this day with you. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.*

*Begin warmly but purposefully:*

Good morning and welcome to our retreat on Grace and the Theological Virtues. Today is not primarily about learning information—though you will learn. Today is about *encounter*. We want you to meet Jesus in a deeper way and to receive what He wants to give you.

### The Day's Schedule (3 minutes)

*Walk through the day:*

Here's what our day looks like:

**Morning Foundation:**
- **8:00 AM** — We're here now, setting the foundation
- **8:30 AM** — We'll move to the Sanctuary to pray the Rosary together
- **9:00 AM** — Mass (open to the public—this is the heart of our day)
- **9:50 AM** — Short break

**Four Teaching Sessions:**
After Mass, we'll have four teaching sessions:
1. **Session 1: Grace** — God's Gift of Himself
2. **Session 2: Faith** — Believing in Love
3. **Session 3: Hope** — Trusting in Love's Promise
4. **Session 4: Love** — Participating in God's Life

**Lunch:** 12:30 PM (30 minutes)

**Closing:** 3:30 PM — Integration and commissioning in the Sanctuary

**End:** 4:30 PM (hard stop)

### The Rhythm of Each Session (3 minutes)

*Explain the teaching-prayer-discussion pattern:*

Each teaching session follows the same rhythm:

1. **30 minutes of Teaching** — Here in the Parish Hall, we'll explore each virtue together
2. **25 minutes of Prayer with Jesus** — We'll move to the Sanctuary where the Blessed Sacrament will be exposed. This is your time to talk directly to Jesus about what you've heard.
3. **20 minutes of Group Discussion** — We'll return here to share what struck us during our time with Jesus

*Emphasize the prayer time:*

**This is important:** The prayer time is not a break. It's the most important part of each session.

After each teaching, we're going to ask you to go to Jesus and talk to Him about what He's inviting you to. A deeper faith. A stronger hope. A more complete love.

Don't just think about what you learned—*bring it to Him*. Ask Him questions. Tell Him your struggles. Listen for His voice in the silence.

The Blessed Sacrament will be exposed after Mass, which means Jesus is truly present—Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity. You're not praying to a symbol. You're sitting with a Person who loves you and wants to speak to your heart.


## Part 2: What Is a Virtue? (5 minutes)

### The Basic Concept (2 minutes)

**"So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love."** 1 Corinthians 13:13 (NABRE)

This is what we are focusing on today.  The Church calls these - faith, hope and love - the theological virtues.

Before we dive into the theological virtues, let's make sure we understand what a virtue is.

**CCC 1803:** *"A virtue is an habitual and firm disposition to do the good. It allows the person not only to perform good acts, but to give the best of himself."*

Think of it this way: A virtue is a good habit of the soul. It's not just doing something good once—it's becoming the kind of person who does good *naturally*, almost without thinking.

### Examples of Virtue (1 minute)

*Make it concrete:*

- A **patient** person doesn't just hold their tongue once when frustrated—patience has become part of who they are
- A **generous** person doesn't just give occasionally—generosity flows from their character
- A **courageous** person doesn't just act bravely in one moment—courage is woven into their soul

Virtues are like spiritual muscles. The more you exercise them, the stronger they become.

### Two Kinds of Virtue (2 minutes)

*Distinguish human and theological virtues:*

The Church teaches that there are two kinds of virtues:

**1. Human Virtues:**
- **Cardinal Virtues:** Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, Temperance
- **Other Human Virtues:** Patience, Humility, Chastity, Generosity, Diligence, Kindness, Gratitude, Honesty, Compassion, Meekness, Modesty
- These can be acquired to some degree through human effort and practice
- They perfect our natural human capacities
- However, they reach their full perfection only when animated by "grace" and the theological virtues of faith, hope and love.
- They are rooted in the theological virtues of faith, hope and love (CCC 1812)

**2. Theological Virtues:**
- Faith, Hope, and Love (Charity)
- These theological virtues are *infused* by God into our souls—He is their author and source
- These virtues are what *enables* us to love God and neighbor
- We receive them, cooperate with them, and *grow in them through grace*
- They connect us to God Himself and when we practice them, we connect God to others

This brings us to the heart of today's retreat...


## Part 3: What Is a Theological Virtue? (7 minutes)

### Why "Theological"? (3 minutes)

*Explain the three reasons:*

The virtues of Faith, Hope, and Love are called "theological" for three specific reasons (CCC 1812):

**1. God is their ORIGIN**
- God infuses them directly into our souls
- We don't obtain these virtues through our own willpower
- They are pure gift - we cannot earn or create them in our soul

**2. God is their OBJECT**
- These virtues are directed toward God Himself
- Faith believes *in God*
- Hope trusts *in God's promises*
- Love loves *God* above all else (and neighbor for God's sake)

**3. God is their MOTIVE**
- We practice these virtues *because of who God is*
- Not to earn rewards or avoid punishment
- But because God is worthy of our faith, our hope, and our love

**CCC 1813:** *"The theological virtues are the foundation of Christian moral activity; they animate it and give it its special character. They inform and give life to all the moral virtues. They are infused by God into the souls of the faithful to make them capable of acting as his children and of meriting eternal life."*

*Key insight:*

Notice the pattern: **God acts first. We respond.**

This is the Catholic understanding of salvation. God initiates. God gives. God enables. And then—by His grace—we are able to respond with faith, hope, and love.

### Why These Three? (2 minutes)

*Connect to Scripture:*

St. Paul names these three virtues together:

**1 Corinthians 13:13 (NABRE):**
> *"So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love."*

These are the three virtues that remain for eternity. When we see God face to face:
- Faith will become sight (we'll see what we believed)
- Hope will become possession (we'll have what we hoped for)
- But Love will remain forever, because God IS Love


## Part 4: Why We Start with Grace (5 minutes)

### The Foundation of Everything (2 minutes)

**Without grace, the theological virtues are impossible.**


### The Order of Today's Sessions (2 minutes)

*Show the logical progression:*

This is why our sessions are ordered the way they are:

1. **Grace** — God gives us His life (the foundation)
2. **Faith** — We believe in the God who gives (our first response)
3. **Hope** — We trust in what God promises (confidence in His faithfulness)
4. **Love** — We participate in God's own life (the goal of everything)

Each session builds on the one before. Grace enables faith. Faith opens us to hope. Hope flowers into love. And love is the goal—because God IS Love, and He created us to share in His love forever.

### What Jesus Wants to Give You Today (1 minute)

*Set the tone for the day:*

As we begin this day, I want you to know: Jesus might want to give you something today.

Maybe it's a deeper faith—to believe what you've struggled to believe.
Maybe it's a stronger hope—to trust Him with something you've been carrying alone.
Maybe it's a more complete love—to receive His love and let it overflow to others.

Whatever it is, He's here. He's present. And He's inviting you into something deeper.

Let us prepare to go to Him together in the Rosary.

*Sign of the Cross*

*Lord Jesus, as we go now to pray the Rosary with Your Mother, open our hearts to receive all You wish to give us today. Amen.*

*Sign of the Cross*
