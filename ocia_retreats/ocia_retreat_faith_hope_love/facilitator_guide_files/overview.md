# Facilitator Overview

## Retreat Purpose

This retreat is designed to help catechumens in the Catechumenate stage deepen their understanding of how they personally receive and respond to God's love through **grace** and the **theological virtues of faith, hope, and love**.

## Participant Background

These catechumens have already completed instruction on:
- The existence of God and the problem of evil
- Love as the integration of truth, justice, and mercy
- The dignity of the human person
- The Blessed Trinity
- God's covenant plan
- Jesus Christ
- The Church and its four marks
- Scripture and Tradition
- The Mass
- Mary and the Communion of Saints
- The Sacramental Economy

**This retreat builds on that foundation** by focusing on the personal encounter with God.

## Retreat Goals

By the end of this retreat, participants should:

1. **Understand Grace** — Know that grace is God's free gift of His divine life, not something we earn
2. **Embrace Faith** — Recognize faith as a response to God's self-revelation
3. **Cultivate Hope** — Distinguish Christian hope from mere optimism
4. **Live Love** — See love as the greatest virtue that integrates all others
5. **Experience Encounter** — Have personal time with Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament

## Session Flow

Each session follows this pattern:

| Phase | Duration | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Teaching** | 30 min | Parish Hall | Present the content |
| **Prayer with Jesus** | 25 min | Sanctuary | Personal encounter with the Blessed Sacrament |
| **Group Discussion** | 20 min | Parish Hall | Share insights and process together |

**Key Insight:** The prayer time comes *after* teaching so participants can bring what they learned directly to Jesus. The discussion comes *after* prayer so they can share what they experienced.
