# Facilitator Tips

## Leading Discussions

### The Opening Question

Always begin each discussion with:

> *"What struck you most during your time with Jesus? What insight or feeling did you experience?"*

**Why this works:**
- It's open-ended and non-threatening
- It honors what God did during prayer time
- It invites personal sharing, not "right answers"
- It creates space for the Holy Spirit

### If the Group is Quiet

- Wait. Silence is okay. Count to 10 slowly before speaking.
- Share briefly from your own experience first
- Ask: "What was it like to sit with Jesus just now?"
- Use one of the backup questions from the schedule

### If Someone Dominates

- Thank them and redirect: "That's beautiful. Let's hear from someone else."
- Make eye contact with quieter participants
- Ask specifically: "What about you, [name]?"

### If Someone Shares Something Heavy

- Thank them for their honesty
- Don't try to fix or solve
- Acknowledge: "That sounds really hard. Thank you for trusting us with that."
- Remind them: "Jesus heard that too, just now in the Sanctuary."
- Follow up privately after the session if needed

## Teaching Tips

### Keep It Personal
- Share your own struggles and growth
- Use "we" language, not "you should"
- Connect doctrine to real life

### Keep It Moving
- 30 minutes goes fast
- Don't try to cover everything
- Hit the main points; trust the Holy Spirit

### Keep It Prayerful
- You're not just informing; you're forming
- Pause for emphasis
- Let Scripture breathe

## Managing Time

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 5-minute warning | Wrap up current point |
| Time's up | Finish your sentence and transition |
| Bell/chime | Move to next location |

**Be disciplined about time.** The schedule is tight, and the 4:30 PM end is a hard stop.

## Handling Common Situations

### Someone Arrives Late
- Welcome them quietly
- Give them a Participant Guide
- Don't stop to catch them up

### Someone Needs to Leave Early
- That's okay; thank them for coming
- Offer to connect later

### Technical Difficulties
- Have a backup plan (no slides needed)
- The content is in the Participant Guide
- Keep going; don't let tech derail the retreat

### Someone is Emotional
- This is good—the Holy Spirit is working
- Have tissues available
- Don't rush them
- A team member can sit with them if needed

## Prayer for Facilitators

Before the retreat, pray together as a team:

> Lord Jesus, we place this retreat in Your hands.
> We are not the ones who will change hearts—You are.
> Help us to decrease so that You may increase.
> Give us wisdom, patience, and love.
> Protect this day from distraction and disruption.
> Let every participant encounter Your love.
> Mary, Mother of the Church, pray for us.
> St. Thérèse, St. Thomas, St. Josephine Bakhita, St. Maximilian Kolbe—pray for us.
> Amen.

## After the Retreat

### Debrief Questions
1. What went well?
2. What would we do differently?
3. Who might need follow-up?
4. What did we learn for next time?

### Follow-Up
- Send a thank-you note to participants
- Check in with anyone who seemed to be struggling
- Connect them with ongoing OCIA formation
- Pray for them by name
