2. **James 4:1-2 (NABRE)**: "Where do the wars and where do the conflicts among you come from? Is it not from your passions that make war within your members? You covet but do not possess. You kill and envy but you cannot obtain; you fight and wage war. You do not possess because you do not ask."
3. **Romans 1:24-32 (NABRE)**: "Therefore, God handed them over to impurity through the lusts of their hearts for the mutual degradation of their bodies. They exchanged the truth of God for a lie and revered and worshiped the creature rather than the creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.

4. **Galatians 5:19-21 (NABRE)**: "Now the works of the flesh are obvious: immorality, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, rivalry, jealousy, outbursts of fury, acts of selfishness, dissensions, factions, occasions of envy, drinking bouts, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God."

Because of these, the wrath of God is coming [upon the disobedient]. By these you too once conducted yourselves, when you lived in that way. But now you must put them all away: anger, fury, malice, slander, and obscene language out of your mouths."
7. **Romans 6:23 (NABRE)**: "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."
8. **1 John 3:4 (NABRE)**: "Everyone who commits sin commits lawlessness, for sin is lawlessness."
9. **Proverbs 6:16-19 (NABRE)**: "There are six things the Lord hates, yes, seven are an abomination to him; Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, A heart that devises wicked plans, feet that run swiftly to evil, The false witness who utters lies, and the one who sows discord among kindred."
10. **Matthew 15:19-20 (NABRE)**: "For from the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, unchastity, theft, false witness, blasphemy. These are what defile a person, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile."

- **Faith and Trust**: Faith in God necessitates trusting His commandments and guidance.
