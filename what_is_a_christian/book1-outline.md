# *What is Love?: Recovering the Heart of the Gospel: Truth, Justice, and Mercy in Action*

**Overall Goal:** Help Catholics understand the depth and beauty of their faith through the lens of authentic love. This book aims to show how salvation is entering into a true love relationship with Christ and living that out - not merely intellectual assent or ritual participation, but a complete commitment that transforms every aspect of life. Through short, progressive chapters that build upon each other, readers will discover how the Catholic faith offers the complete vision of love that our broken world desperately needs, and how living this faith within families creates a legacy that extends for generations.

**Audience:** Catholic Christians seeking to deepen their understanding of faith beyond ritual participation

## PART I: THE PROBLEM AND THE PROMISE

**Chapter 1: The Broken Compass: Society Adrift from Truth**

*Goal: Establish the problem – the loss of objective truth and moral grounding in contemporary society.*

1. **The Disconnect:** Begin by painting a vivid picture of the problems:
   * Widespread societal disorientation and disconnect from reality

2. **The Symptoms of the Disease:** Connect these problems to specific manifestations:
   * "Wokeness" and its often-unintended consequences
   * The proliferation of "fake racism" accusations and race-baiting
   * The distorted understanding of "reproductive rights"

3. **What Wokeness Is Fighting For, But Where It Went Wrong:** Examine the legitimate concerns and fundamental errors:

   * The error of reducing human relations to power dynamics

   * The absence of any objective standard or guiding principles of truth resulting in justice and mercy run amok

   * A disconnect from the natural world and the realities of the human body, mind, and soul

5. **The Yearning for Something More:** Acknowledge that even in these misguided movements, there's a kernel of truth:
