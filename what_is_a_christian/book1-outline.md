# *What is Love?: Recovering the Heart of the Gospel: Truth, Justice, and Mercy in Action*

## Book Purpose

This book is intended to help Catholics understand the depth and beauty of their faith through understanding the formal
definition of objective, authentic, true love which is the God's perfect union of truth, justice, and mercy.
This book aims to show that the Biblical model of Salvation is entering into a true love relationship with Christ
and living that out - WITH our whole heart, soul, mind, and strength. Basically it aims to help us understand
what Salvation is, what Jesus wants to save us from, why this is what is causing such a mess in the world today,
and how the Catholic Faith is the only way for the world to be "saved".  Quite the bold statement, but the hear
me out and if what I say is true, then we have a huge gift to offer a world desperate for truth, justice, and mercy.

Once we understand sin, salvation and what love actually is, we can understand how that everything that the Church
does and teaches is designed to help us grow in this understanding through our love relationship with Christ
SO THAT we can be part of Jesus' mission to "save the world".

What do we need Salvation from?

Looking around in the world today, we see society breaking down all around us.  And we hear the cries of the people
demanding justice, demanding equity, inclusion, racial justice, an end to gun violence, an end to police brutality,
an end to racism, an end to sexism, an end to homophobia and transphobia, etc, etc, etc.

But as the song goes, they are "looking for love in all the wrong places"!  What is the solution to every single
one of these problems?  The answer is found in the Gospel.  The answer is found in the fullness of the Christian faith.
The answer is found when we truly understand the meaning of love.

That true love is God's perfect union of truth, justice, and mercy!

That in order for their to be any justice, equality, inclusion, racial justice, an end to gun violence,
an end to police brutality, an end to racism, an end to sexism, an end to homophobia, an end to transphobia, an end
to all forms of discrimination and oppression, what must be pursued is ACTUAL truth, ACTUAL justice and ACTUAL mercy!

Any form of justice that is not aimed toward perfect justice will just cause more injustice!
And any form of mercy that is not aimed toward perfect mercy will cause more suffering!
And any form of truth that is not aimed toward perfect truth will be a lie and lead to insanity!

In other words, we must pursue an objectively good and perfect unity of truth, justice, and mercy!

And THAT is what our Catholic faith teaches us!  As human beings, we may not have access to HIS perfect WISDOM
of truth, justice, and mercy, but we do have the Holy Spirit who has been guiding the Church for 2000 years
to help us understand the truth, seek justice, and show mercy!  THAT is what the Catholic Faith is trying to help us understand at every turn...

But when we as Catholics understand the "why" behind all the Catholic things we do - we see that the Church,
through God's Holy Spirit, is helping us understand what love is.

That LOVE requires UNITY in the Body of Christ!
Which requires us to submit to an authority that Jesus established in the Church.

That LOVE requires UNITY and COMMUNION with Christ himself that we get to experience most fully in Holy Communion but also
in all of the Sacraments.

That LOVE requires WORSHIP - that is the purpose of Mass - to teach us to be a reverent, humble, obedient servant to our Lord
so that we increase in our increase in our knowledge for truth, justice and mercy and so that we increase in our
love for Him and for each other.

That LOVE requires TRUTH - that is the purpose of the Bible and the Church's Magisterium.  That we need to be able to
properly understand the truth about God, ourselves as human beings, and the world around us.

That LOVE requires JUSTICE - that is the purpose of the Church's social teaching.  That we need to be able to
properly understand what justice is and how we can properly administer it.

That LOVE requires MERCY when we sin. This is the purpose of Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the World.
This is the purpose of the Sacrament of Confession/Reconciliation/Penance.  This is why we confess our sins at every Mass.

This book is going to walk through all the major teachings of the Catholic Faith in a way that helps us truly
understand the relationship of love to truth, justice, and mercy. So that our Faith is not just a set of beliefs
but a way of life that we can actually live out in our daily lives and that we can actually help others to do the same.

My prayer is for the World.  That the World will come to know Jesus who is the Truth, the Way and the Life.  That
he is the incarnation of the perfect union of truth, justice, and mercy.  That we will be able to show the world
the beauty, the truth, and the love of the Catholic Faith so that they will want to know Him.  And that the
Catholic Faith will continue to be a light to the World and salt of the Earth.








**Audience:** Catholic Christians seeking to deepen their understanding of faith beyond ritual participation

## PART I: THE PROBLEM AND THE PROMISE

### Chapter 1: Virtue Signaling: Society's Hollow Tradition

*Premise: Modern society has created a "tradition" of leaders promoting ideas that sound virtuous but lack foundation, resulting in well-intentioned followers regurgitating concepts like "equity" and "inclusion" without understanding their true meaning or how to achieve them.*

*Key Scriptures:*
- "People will be self-centered and lovers of money, proud, haughty, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, irreligious, callous, implacable, slanderous, licentious, brutal, hating what is good, traitors, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, as they make a pretense of religion but deny its power." (2 Timothy 3:2-5, NABRE)
- "Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but underneath are ravenous wolves. By their fruits you will know them." (Matthew 7:15-16, NABRE)
- "Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the road broad that leads to destruction, and those who enter through it are many. How narrow the gate and constricted the road that leads to life. And those who find it are few." (Matthew 7:13-14, NABRE)
- "Why do you notice the splinter in your brother's eye, but do not perceive the wooden beam in your own eye?" (Matthew 7:3, NABRE)
- "Thus you nullify the word of God in favor of your tradition that you have handed on. And you do many such things." (Mark 7:13, NABRE)
- "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites. You are like whitewashed tombs, which appear beautiful on the outside, but inside are full of dead men's bones and every kind of filth." (Matthew 23:27, NABRE)
- "For they preach but they do not practice." (Matthew 23:3, NABRE)
- "If I speak in human and angelic tongues but do not have love, I am a resounding gong or a clashing cymbal." (1 Corinthians 13:1, NABRE)
- "For the time will come when people will not tolerate sound doctrine but, following their own desires and insatiable curiosity, will accumulate teachers and will stop listening to the truth and will be diverted to myths." (2 Timothy 4:3-4, NABRE)
- "They promise them freedom, though they themselves are slaves of corruption, for a person is a slave of whatever overcomes him." (2 Peter 2:19, NABRE)
- "Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who change darkness into light and light into darkness, who change bitter into sweet and sweet into bitter!" (Isaiah 5:20, NABRE)

1. **The Disconnect:** Begin by painting a vivid picture of the problems:
   * Widespread societal disorientation and disconnect from reality
   * The loss of shared values and a sense of common purpose
   * Increased polarization, conflict, and distrust
   * The rise of "virtue signaling," performative activism, and shallow engagement

2. **The Symptoms of the Disease:** Connect these problems to specific manifestations:
   * "Wokeness" and its often-unintended consequences
   * The proliferation of "fake racism" accusations and race-baiting
   * The distorted understanding of "reproductive rights"
   * The challenges posed by transgender ideology

3. **What Wokeness Is Fighting For, But Where It Went Wrong:** Examine the legitimate concerns and fundamental errors:
   * The valid desire for justice and equality that drives these movements
   * The Marxist foundation that derails modern movements (wokeness, intersectionality, critical theories)
   * The error of reducing human relations to power dynamics
   * Why seeking power as the primary goal creates perpetual injustice
   * The mistake of blaming groups rather than addressing individual sin and disorder
   * Why societal problems cannot be solved without ordering individual desires toward true justice
   * The impossibility of achieving justice through collective blame and power redistribution
   * How these movements misdiagnose the human condition and therefore prescribe ineffective remedies

4. **The Underlying Cause: A Loss of Foundation:** Explain that all of these issues stem from a deeper problem:
   * The absence of any objective standard or guiding principles of truth resulting in justice and mercy run amok
   * A reliance on subjective feelings, emotions, and personal opinions
   * A "progressive" movement that is without any boundaries or limits or "commandments" - everything is relative and fluid
   * A disconnect from the natural world and the realities of the human body, mind, and soul

5. **The Yearning for Something More:** Acknowledge that even in these misguided movements, there's a kernel of truth:
   * A genuine desire for freedom, justice, mercy, and virtue
   * A passion for fighting for ideals and making the world a better place
   * But these desires are misdirected without a solid foundation

6. **The Catholic Solution: Anchoring in Truth:** Introduce the Catholic faith as a source of objective truth and moral guidance:
   * Explain that the Catholic faith provides a balanced and coherent understanding of Truth, Justice, and Mercy
   * Emphasize the importance of God's wisdom in guiding our lives and shaping society

7. **A Call to Action for Catholics:** Challenge Catholics to take their faith more seriously:
   * We need to know, live, and teach our faith better than ever before
   * This is how we evangelize: one person, one family at a time
   * This is our time to truly be able to tell the complete story of the whole "Gospel" – the good news
   * We have the answers the world is searching for

(1 Corinthians 13:4-6, NABRE)
- "So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love." (1 Corinthians 13:13, NABRE)
- "No one has greater love than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends." (John 15:13, NABRE)
- "In this way the love of God was revealed to us: God sent his only Son into the world so that we might have life through him." (1 John 4:9, NABRE)
- "There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment, and so one who fears is not yet perfect in love." (1 John 4:18, NABRE)
- "We love because he first loved us." (1 John 4:19, NABRE)
- "If anyone says, 'I love God,' but hates his brother, he is a liar; for whoever does not love a brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen." (1 John 4:20, NABRE)
