# The Sacred Unity of Love: A Catholic Understanding for Today's World

## Introduction

When I was 19, on a church retreat at the "Emmaus" retreat center in Panama, God taught me His first lesson that I have never stopped thinking about:

> "God is love, and whoever remains in love remains in God and God in him." (1 John 4:16).

"God is Love".  Wow - amazing... That one statement changed my entire life.  But it also raised an important question:  "What does that mean????" And so I just resigned myself to keep learning more and more about what that meant.

Now, 37 years later, through so much learning, studying, thinking, teaching and talking - God, through His Church has helped me bring it all together into a clear, concise, and simple understanding of what love is.

Also, I have studied deeply the "sola fide" ("by faith alone") controversy that still divides so many in the Christian world. This has forced me to see the relationship between faith, love, truth and salvation that seems to make it all make sense.

And why is this important?  Or "How important is it that we understand this"?

It seems to me the most consequential question of this age - "What is love?".

It seems obvious to me that the biggest problem in the world today is that as a society, we no longer know what love is.

When I was a "youth pastor" I asked my kids one night - "Is it possible to know objectively - for certain - what is evil and what is good?" - out of the 15 present that night, 13 said "No" - 1 wasn't sure and 1 said "Yes" - we can know from the Bible. These were GOOD Church kids!  But they swim in the waters in our society that are telling them THERE IS NO OBJECTIVE TRUTH!  Post modernism is the water these kids swim in. As Christians, we need to raise up an offense against this heresy against humanity.  And is it that serious?  Well, without any objective truth, there is no such thing as an objective morality.  Without that, society will (and is) fall apart. And without an objective truth - Love is a fiction - it is whatever you want it to be.  It has no rules, no boundaries, anything goes.

And so my point is that our Faith - if it is true - better have a substantial and compelling answer to this claim that "there is no objective truth".  But it seems to me, the answer is not "the Bible" - as those who do not trust God's Word in the Bible, will not see it as "objective truth", so we must appeal to a truth that they already understand and trust - their own heart.

So again, our answer could be - God is love... but again, what DOES THAT MEAN?

Let me just lay out the words God has given me to describe love. As far as I can tell, there is nothing new here. When you read it, you will say - of course - that is what the Bible teaches! When you read scripture after hearing this definition, you will say - of course - this makes more sense!

Here is the definition:

> Love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and mercy into life-giving communion.

Wow - that is a mouthful - it is a deeply packed definition - every word was carefully chosen to try to capture the "heart", the core of what love is... said more simply:

> Love is the unity of God's true justice, and mercy.

In other words, the way we know we are doing love correctly, the way we "do love" is to look to God to learn about His perfect justice and His perfect mercy and then pray for the Wisdom to know how to unify these into every relationship we have - starting with God and then eminating out to our "neighbor".

Quick example to illustrate my point. Every good father knows that he must teach his children right from wrong.  Does he do this by beating his five year old "mercilessly" every time he steps out of line? - Of course not this is justice without mercy.  Well, does he do this by allowing his child to do whatever he wants and then just "hopes" he will learn from his own mistakes? Of course not, this is mercy without justice.

His child - his own creation deserves much better.  The child is literally created in the parents own image - he deserves to know what is right from wrong so that he can grow up to be someone who can use his gifts, talents and abilities to make the world a better place (i.e. to "love").  He does not deserve to end up in prison or strung out on drugs, or in multiple failed marriages with custody battle chaos.  The parents intuitively know they want what is best for their child.

And so - what is the goal of parenting?  To love their children deeply and to teach their child how to love. So through their example, they demonstrate a proper balance of justice and mercy in all things.  A reward for a job well done - that is proper justice. Forgiving them for a wrong they committed, that is proper mercy.  Administering discipline effectively but proper to their age, development, etc is a proper balancing of justice and mercy.

The family is SO important here - because it is the FIRST and most IMPORTANT teacher of love! But if the parents don't know what love is - if they are not deeply rooted in God's Truth about His Justice and Mercy, they will have a much more diminished ability to love and teach love properly.

As "well meaning Christian parents" we never really knew what our goal was with our children.  I knew that disciple was important, but mostly because my father was pretty strict with discipline.  I don't think he knew the goal either.  You feel it somewhat intuitively, but when you put these words to it, it makes so much sense.

And the ramifications of a poor family life that has little regard for either justice or mercy are endless - divorce, children split between parents, abuse of children as well as substance abuse - I maintain that most all of this is caused by ignorance of and imbalances of God's justice and mercy and the role they play in the human heart and in living out life.

And now with the advent of social media, our children are exposed to all manners of incorrect teaching. Liberalism, relativism, post-modernism, materialism, trans-genderism - they are all over the internet and our children are learning from them!  And so we need to be able to teach our children - and all that we come in contact with about the transformative power behind God's love (and we must know what that means of course).

> This article is a summary of a book I am working on called "What is Love?, The Heart of the Gospel for Catholics".  In that book I will go into much greater detail to lay out the biblical foundation for the Catholic understanding of love as well as showing how the depth of Catholic teaching teaches us how to Love God and our neighbor properly.

Liberalism, post-modernism, marxism, feminism, materialism, gender ideology, and LGBTQ+ advocacy ALL have similar flaws - they start with some flawed premise of human dignity, gender, or sexuality and then try to enact some skewed ideas of justice or mercy based on that flawed premise. There is no firm foundation for any of these ideologies.

They are all "looking for love in all the wrong places" – conducting failed experiments in human flourishing without the Christian model that perfectly integrates truth, justice, and mercy.

The evidence surrounds us: these approaches lead to mental and spiritual confusion, destruction, and ultimately death – both spiritual and physical.

But here is the beautiful thing. We have an "in" to start a discussion with anyone caught up in these ideologies - and even the athiest or agnostic.  They all recognize the needs for justice and mercy!  This is what they all want!

For example, we hear cries of "Black lives matter!", "No justice, No Peace", "Silence is violence", "My body, my choice", "Equal pay for equal work", "Trans rights are human rights".

Forget about what they are advocating for and realize that in ever single "slogan" they are desiring some type of justice! And as Christians, we have a very easy question we can ask them

> Are you seeking perfect justice or imperfect justice?

That opens the door to a conversation about - "What is justice"? "Does it need to be properly tempered with mercy"? "Are we fighting for justice at the expense of others, or justice for all"?

This is just a taste, but you probably already see the point...

And so, as members of the Body of Christ, we have a sacred and moral responsibility to understand and teach the Catholic integrated vision of love and then to bring it into every corner of our society. Jesus calls us to be the light of the world and the salt of the earth.  Let us proclaim the "good news" of God's definition of love and Jesus example to show us how to live it out SACRIFICALLY.

The "good news" is that the Catholic Church teaching of the faith - as it has been handed down to us from Jesus, through the Apostles - teaches that Love is at the heart of the Gospel:

> He said to him, ""You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the greatest and the first commandment. The second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments.
> -- (Matthew 22:37-40, NABRE)

And Jesus also said:

> Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets. I have not come to abolish but to fulfill.
> -- (Matthew 5:17, NABRE)

And Paul tells us:

> Love does no evil to the neighbor; hence, love is the fulfillment of the law. (Romans 13:10, NABRE)

In the rest of this article, I just want to touch on the highlights of Catholic teaching on these topics. The Catholic faith is so rich and deep and I pray that this will spur you to want to go deeper in learning your faith, so that you can teach it to others (after all that is what Jesus asked the very first members of His church to do in Matthew 28:18-20 - "teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you")

## First some definitions per the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC)

### Truth

Pope St. John Paul II in his encyclical "[Veritatis splendor](https://https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_06081993_veritatis-splendor.html)" gives a wonderul preliminary definition we can work with:

> The splendour of truth shines forth in all the works of the Creator and, in a special way, in man, created in the image and likeness of God (cf. Gen 1:26). Truth enlightens man's intelligence and shapes his freedom, leading him to know and love the Lord. Hence the Psalmist prays: "Let the light of your face shine on us, O Lord" (Ps 4:6).

Truth is at is core is the alignment of our thoughts with all of reality (not just the Bible) as it so beautifully describes in the Catechsim paragraph 2500:

> But truth can also find other complementary forms of human expression, above all when it is a matter of evoking what is beyond words: the depths of the human heart, the exaltations of the soul, the mystery of God. Even before revealing himself to man in words of truth, God reveals himself to him through the universal language of creation, the work of his Word, of his wisdom: the order and harmony of the cosmos—which both the child and the scientist discover—'from the greatness and beauty of created things comes a corresponding perception of their Creator,' 'for the author of beauty created them.'"
>
> --- CCC 2500

In other words, God created us with the gift of intellect so that we might be able to recognize His Truth in the reality that we live in.  We must use that intellect to discern what is good, true and beautiful - to recognize His "revelation" to us - AND THE CHURCH HAS! For 2000 years of those following Christ and at least another 4000 years before that, in the Jewish people, men have been using their intellect to uncover "Truth" given to us by our Creator.  The Catholic teachings of the truth of faith, hope, charity, justice, mercy, virtues and so much more help us understand love as deeply as we need to go.

And so then, if anyone desires ACTUAl justice and actual MERCY, they must look for "true" justice and "true" mercy.  Justice and Mercy - rooted in "Truth" - that comes from our Creator, not simply by human intellect alone - and certainly not from human "opinion" from very unwise people.

### Justice

> Justice is the moral virtue that consists in the constant and firm will to give their due to God and neighbor. Justice toward God is called the "virtue of religion". Justice toward men disposes one to respect the rights of each and to establish in human relationships the harmony that promotes equity with regard to person and to the common good. The just man, often mentioned in the Sacred Scriptures, is distinguished by habitual right thinking and the uprightness of his conduct toward his neighbor... (from CCC 1807)

This works in two ways: we should treat others with the proper dignity and respect they deserve as human beings, and we must also accept that our own actions have consequences, including punishment when we do wrong.

### Mercy

Mercy is how God responds with compassion when we suffer or sin, and giving us the example that we too should forgive others for the sake of peace and communion in all our relationships. (CCC 1422, 2840)

### Love

Love is choosing to put God first and to care for others as much as we care for ourselves because that's what God wants. (CCC 1822) Love is when justice and mercy work together - it ensures we treat people fairly while also showing compassion when they fall short.

The Catechism teaches that love fulfills and elevates justice: "The practice of all the virtues is animated and inspired by charity, which 'binds everything together in perfect harmony'" (CCC 1827). It further states that genuine love requires justice as its minimum expression.

The Bible and the Catechism portray these fundamental moral goods—truth, justice, love, and mercy—as a unified whole rather than isolated concepts, with love being the foundation from which the others flow and find their fullest meaning.

## Love: The Heart of "The Gospel"

At the center of our faith lies a profound understanding of love that goes far beyond what our culture typically recognizes. While the world often reduces love to sentiment or emotional attachment, our tradition offers something much deeper. Here is a deeply packed definition of love:

> Perfect love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and mercy into life-giving communion.

This definition, rooted in Scripture and Church teaching, reveals why the Catholic vision of love is so transformative. Each word is deeply packed with meaning:

- **Sacred**: Love flows from God Himself — "God is love" (1 John 4:8).
- **Sacrificial**: Following Christ's example, authentic love requires sacrifice — "No one has greater love than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends" (John 15:13).
- **binds**: We must be bound by truth, justice, and mercy in God's wisdom, not our own.
- **Covenant**: Love establishes familial relationships with mutual obligations, not just feelings.
- **true**: Love depends on reality as God sees it — "The truth will set you free" (John 8:32).
- **Justice**: Love gives God and each person their "due" according to their God-given dignity.
- **Mercy**: Love responds to brokenness with healing — "Blessed are the merciful" (Matthew 5:7)
- **Life-giving**: Love properly lived out transforms us to be more like Christ.
- **Communion**: Love creates unity with God and others — "That they may all be one" (John 17:21).

This integrated understanding of love provides us with a powerful framework for both deepening our own faith and evangelizing in today's world.

## The Trinity: Perfect Love in Communion

Taking everything I described above togther, and we begin to approach our understanding of the Most Holy Trinity—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in perfect communion. The Trinity reveals that love is not merely what God is, but that it is what he does. This eternal exchange of love within the Godhead shows us that authentic love is always relational, self-giving, and life-generating.

Holy Communion is our participation in this Trinitarian communion!

> "The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? Because the loaf of bread is one, we, though many, are one body, for we all partake of the one loaf." (1 Corinthians 10:16-17, NABRE)

> "Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him on the last day. For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him." (John 6:54-56, NABRE)

The Eucharist is the supreme example of love as the sacred, sacrificial gift that established His New Covenant with us, upholds truth and justice, extends mercy, and creates communion. This is why the Eucharist is the source and summit of our Faith. It is our best God's supreme example of where truth, justice, mercy, and love are all in perfect communion. And we have been given the gift of experience this perfect love in the Eucharist every day that we can get to Mass!

## Responding to Modern Challenges

As Catholics faithful to the Church's teaching, we often encounter modern ideologies that fragment the unity of love, truth, justice, and mercy:

- **Postmodernism** claims that there is no objective truth, rendering authentic love ordered toward anything "good" impossible. There is nothing good, no justice, no mercy, no truth.
- **Relativism** claims there is no objective truth, rendering authentic love ordered toward anything "good" impossible. "My Truth" is no truth.
- **Liberalism** emphasizes man's desire to establish moral law without an objective truth and so easily distorts the truth of how human beings were made.
- **Individualism** prioritizes personal autonomy over covenant relationships. We are all born by and into a family, we are raised and exist in 'community' (note the ideas of 'communion' and 'unity' embedded in the word). We are members of the Body of Christ, the household of God, the Kingdom - not just autonomous individuals. Nothing we do is in isolation.
- **Sentimentalism** reduces love to feelings, often separated from truth, commitment or mercy. Convinces people to stay in broken relationships even when when justice and mercy has been violated.
- **Marxism** emphasizes a human beings need for power in order to achieve a better society.  Completely devoid of truth of how human beings were made.
- **Critical Theory** - claims that all human knowledge is a social construct and should be rejected in favor of 'critical' analysis. Causes a disconnect between mind and body which furthers any mental or emotional problems.
- **Feminism** emphasizes equility between men and women, ignoring the beauty and complementarity of the male and female. Justice at the expense of truth.
- **intersectionality** - divides people into groups based on their identity and then claims that these groups have different truths and needs for justice and mercy. It eventually breaks down all the groups down into an individual and never considers that we exist in community.
- **Gender ideology** claims that gender is a social construct, not a biological reality. Causes a disconnect between mind and body which furthers any mental or emotional problems. Truth that we all come from a Creator and are made in his image are cast aside in order to elevate human needs for attention and desires of the flesh to the point of 'God'.
- **Wokeism** emphasizes justice for the oppressed, but often divorced from truth or what is just for the entire community. Wokeism is directly influenced by 'critical theory', 'intersectionality', and Marxism. People 'awake' from religous oppression and desire complete freedom by giving into their human desires.

All of these broken ideologies have led to the fragmentation of society and the breakdown of the family:

- **Divorce**: literally breaks up the unity of the family and devastates the Children who then learn from this broken example of love and live that out.
- **Abortion**: literally murders innocent babies for the sake of convenience and selfishness.
- **Gay marriage**: distorts the model of what marriage is - a union between a man and a woman ordered toward the procreation of children.
- **Transgenderism**: teaches children that they were not made in God's image - they can define their own self. Pulls the rug out from under the family and the children's understanding of what love is.

When evangelizing or discussing contemporary issues, we can explain that the Catholic vision offers a more complete alternative:

1. **On human dignity**: Catholic teaching upholds the inherent worth of every person from conception to natural death, not because of the color of their skin, what they do or contribute, but because they are created in God's image. All discussions of justice and mercy must start with this premise!
2. **On social justice**: Catholic teaching pursues justice grounded in truth and tempered by mercy, recognizing that authentic justice establishes right relationships for all rather than merely redistributing power, wealth, or status. It is never justice for you if it is not justice for your neighbor.
3. **On marriage and family**: Catholic teaching defends the covenant of marriage and the family as the domestic church where love, truth, justice, and mercy are first learned and lived. A healthy family is the foundation of a healthy society.
4. **On moral issues**: We uphold moral teachings not as arbitrary rules but as expressions of love that protect human dignity, establish justice and offer mercy - all according to God's perfect wisdom as has been revealed in Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition.

## Living This Vision in Daily Life

For us as practicing Catholics, this understanding of love transforms how we approach our daily lives:

### In Our Prayer Life

The integrated vision of love deepens our prayer beyond routine:

- In **Eucharistic Adoration**, we encounter Jesus Himself, the perfect unity of truth, love, justice, and mercy
- In the **Sacrament of Reconciliation**, we experience the perfect unity of justice and mercy
- In praying the **Rosary**, we contemplate how Mary's fiat ("Let it be done unto me according to your word") exemplifies sacrificial covenant love

### In Our Families

As the "domestic church," our families become schools of integrated love:

- Parents teach truth by their example and fidelity to Church teaching and participating in the sacraments.
- Family rules and discipline reflect justice that respects each person's dignity.
- Forgiveness within the family models mercy that heals rather than enables.
- Family prayer and attending Mass together fosters communion with God and each other.
- This gives parents direction on how to properly love their children. By learning and teaching the children how to balance justice, mercy and truth.
- We have a clear roadmap for helping our children "become saints". Teach them how to love.

### In Our Evangelization

When sharing our faith with others, this understanding of love provides a compelling message:

- When sharing with non-practicing Catholics, we can help teach them the beauty of the Catholic understanding of love.
- When sharing with non-Catholic Christians, we can help them understand that truth, justice and mercy are not just Christian values, but they are the foundation of all human dignity and flourishing. And that we can easily then show why "faith working through love" is what makes us Christian.
- When sharing with non-Christians, we can approach the discussion of God and religion from purely foundational principles of truth, justice and mercy which they probably already "believe in".
- Bottom line - lead with love - but know what love is...

### In Political Issues

- When addressing difficult moral issues, we have a framework to show how God's wisdom can be applied.  What is the truth of the matter?  What justice is required?  What mercy is needed? How should these be balanced for the good of all?
- When looking at political candidates, we can evaluate their policies and positions based on the principles of their understanding of God's truth, justice, and mercy.

## The Cross: Love's Perfect Expression

At the heart of our Catholic faith stands the Cross — Jesus' ultimate sacrifice as an expression of love as the perfect integration of truth, justice, and mercy. On Calvary, we see:

- The **truth** about sin's gravity and the punishment we deserve
- The **justice** that sin requires, fully satisfied
- The **mercy** that offers forgiveness and healing
- The **covenant** established in Christ's blood
- The **communion** made possible through His sacrifice

When we venerate the Cross or participate in the Mass, we enter into this mystery of integrated love. And when we carry our own crosses in union with Christ, we participate in His redemptive love.

This is what it means to pick up your cross and follow Jesus - to pick up the Cross of truth, justice, mercy and sacrifice and then live it out in your daily life. The more deeply we are able to do this, the more we become "salt of the earth and light of the world" (Matthew 5:13-14), joining Jesus in His mission of Salvation for the entire world.

## Practical Steps for Growth

Start by meditating on this definition:

> Perfect love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and mercy into life-giving communion.

Memorize it, internalize it, be able to explain it.

As Catholics - Jesus' beautiful Church, led by the Holy Spirit, has given us so many beautiful gifts to experience the wisdom and love of God first hand!

1. **Pray the Mass**: Mass is our highest form of prayer. Learn about the why behind everything that is done at the Mass and what it has to teach you about God's love, truth, justice, and mercy.
2. **Liturgy of the Hours** - Pray the Liturgy of the Hours daily.  This is another form of prayer and immersing yourself in God's Word.  Pray with someone else to help grow in wisdom and understanding and to hold each other accountable.
3. **Receive the sacraments frequently**: Experience God's mercy first hand in the Sacraments of Reconciliation and His love in the Eucharist. Learn deeply what each Sacrament means in the Catholic understanding of love especially Holy Communion, Confession/Reconciliation/Penance and Holy Matrimony/Holy Orders.
4. **Study the faith**: Read Scripture, the Catechism, and Church documents on love and relationships. The Bible in a Year and The Catechism in a Year by Father Mike Schmitz are amazing gifts to our Faith.
5. **Build Catholic community**: Share this vision with fellow parishioners through Bible studies or faith-sharing groups
6. **Be part of the 'New Evangelization'**: Make evangelization (by living and sharing the Catholic understanding of love) a part of your daily life. ALWAYS in complete charity attempting to demonstrate the love of Christ, His truth, His justice and His mercy. An argument will only push people away.
   - in every conversation
   - in every action
   - in every decision
   - in every relationship
7. **Live the faith**: Live the faith in your daily life.  This is the most important step of all.  It is the most important step because it is the most important step.  It is the most important step because it is the most important step.
8. **Pray the rosary**: Pray the rosary daily.  This is another form of prayer and immersing yourself in God's Word.
9. **Learn Catholic Apologetics** - Learn to reason properly about the teachings of the Faith. This will help you to see both sides and understand the Catholic understanding of love much more clearly.
10. **Raise a good Catholic Family** - Raise a family that is a reflection of the Catholic understanding of love.
11. **Sends your Kids to faithful Catholic schools and universities**: A great resource for this is the Cardinal Newman Society - https://www.cardinalnewmansociety.org.

## Conclusion

As faithful Catholics in today's world, we possess a treasure in our Church's understanding of love as the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and mercy into life-giving communion. This integrated vision not only deepens our own faith but provides a compelling alternative to the fragmented understandings of love prevalent in our culture.

When we live and share this vision, we follow Christ's command to be "salt of the earth and light of the world" (Matthew 5:13-14). We offer not just critique but a positive vision—one that responds to the deepest longings of the human heart and provides a path toward authentic communion with God and neighbor.

In a world desperately seeking love but often looking in the wrong places, we as Catholics are called to be witnesses to love's true nature—not just in what we say, but in how we live. May our lives increasingly reflect this integrated love, drawing others to the One who is Love itself.
