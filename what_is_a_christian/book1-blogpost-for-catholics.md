# The Sacred Unity of Love: A Catholic Understanding for Today's World

I am convinced that the biggest problem in the world today is that we no longer know what love is.
After decades of society falling further and further from God, we have lost the understanding of what love is.

This article is a summary of a book I am working on called "What is Love?, The Heart of the Gospel for Catholics".  In that book I will go into great detail to lay out the biblical foundation for the Catholic understanding of love as well as showing how the depth of Catholic teaching teaches us how to Love God and our Neighbor properly.

In today's fragmented society, we see various ideologies attempting to define the path to human flourishing while rejecting God's design.

Liberalism, Post-modernism, Marxism, Feminism, gender ideology, and LGBTQ+ advocacy ALL have similar flaws - they start with some flawed premise of human dignity, gender, or sexuality and then try to enact some skewed ideas of justice or mercy based on that flawed premise. There is no firm foundation for any of these ideologies.

They are all "looking for love in all the wrong places" – conducting failed experiments in human flourishing without the Christian model that perfectly integrates truth, justice, and mercy.

The evidence surrounds us: these approaches lead to mental and spiritual confusion, destruction, and ultimately death – both spiritual and physical.

As members of the Body of Christ, we have a sacred and moral responsibility to understand and teach the Catholic integrated vision of love, bringing it into every corner of our society. If we fail in this mission, our culture will continue its descent, imploding under the weight of its own fragmented understanding and self-centered pursuits.

The stakes couldn't be higher – souls hang in the balance, and the very fabric of society depends on rediscovering authentic love.

The "good news" is that the Catholic Church teaching of the faith - as it has been handed down to us from Jesus, through the Apostles - teaches that Love is at the heart of the Gospel:

> He said to him, ""You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the greatest and the first commandment. The second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments.
-- (Matthew 22:37-40, NABRE)

And Paul tells us:
> Love does no evil to the neighbor; hence, love is the fulfillment of the law. (Romans 13:10, NABRE)

## First some defintions

### Justice
According to the Catechism, justice is


## Love: The Heart of Our Faith

At the center of our faith lies a profound understanding of love that goes far beyond what our culture typically recognizes. While the world often reduces love to sentiment or emotional attachment, our tradition offers something much deeper. Here is a deeply packed definition of love:

> Perfect love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant-binding truth, justice, and mercy into life-giving communion.

This definition, rooted in Scripture and Church teaching, reveals why the Catholic vision of love is so transformative. Each word is deeply packed with meaning:

- **Sacred**: Love flows from God Himself — "God is love" (1 John 4:8).
- **Sacrificial**: Following Christ's example, authentic love requires sacrifice — "No one has greater love than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends" (John 15:13).
- **binding**: We must be bound by truth, justice, and mercy in God's wisdom, not our own.
- **Covenant**: Love establishes familial relationships with mutual obligations, not just feelings.
- **Truth**: Love acknowledges reality as God sees it — "The truth will set you free" (John 8:32).
- **Justice**: Love gives God and each person their "due" according to their God-given dignity.
- **Mercy**: Love responds to brokenness with healing — "Blessed are the merciful" (Matthew 5:7)
- **Life-giving**: Love properly lived out transforms us to be more like Christ.
- **Communion**: Love creates unity with God and others — "That they may all be one" (John 17:21).



This integrated understanding of love provides us with a powerful framework for both deepening our own faith and evangelizing in today's world.

## The Trinity: Perfect Love in Communion

Taking everything I described above togther, and we begin to approach our understanding of the Most Holy Trinity—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in perfect communion. The Trinity reveals that love is not merely what God is, but that it is what he does. This eternal exchange of love within the Godhead shows us that authentic love is always relational, self-giving, and life-generating.

Holy Communion is our participation in this Trinitarian communion!

> "The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? Because the loaf of bread is one, we, though many, are one body, for we all partake of the one loaf." (1 Corinthians 10:16-17, NABRE)

The Eucharist is the supreme example of love as the sacred, sacrificial gift that established His New Covenant with us, upholds truth and justice, extends mercy, and creates communion. This is why the Eucharist is the source and summit of our Faith. It is our best God's supreme example of where truth, justice, mercy, and love are all in perfect communion. And we have been given the gift of experience this perfect love in the Eucharist every day that we can get to Mass!


## Responding to Modern Challenges

As Catholics faithful to the Church's teaching, we often encounter modern ideologies that fragment the unity of love, truth, justice, and mercy:

- **Relativism** claims there is no objective truth, rendering authentic love ordered toward anything "good"  impossible.
- **Individualism** prioritizes personal autonomy over covenant relationships. We are members of the Body of Christ, the household of God, the Kingdom - not just autonomous individuals. Nothing we do is in isolation.
- **Sentimentalism** reduces love to feelings, divorced from truth and commitment. Convinces people to stay in broken relationships when there is a demonstrable lack of authentic love.
- **Wokeism** emphasizes justice for the oppressed, but often without truth or what is just for all.
- **Marxism** emphasizes a human beings need for power in order to achieve a better society.  Completely devoid of truth of how human beings were made.
- **Liberalism** emphasizes man's desire to establish moral law without an objective truth and so easily distorts the truth of how human beings were made.
- **Feminism** emphasizes equility between men and women, ignoring the beauty and complementarity of the male and female.
- **Gender ideology** claims that gender is a social construct, not a biological reality. Causes a disconnect between mind and body which furthers any mental or emotional problems.
- **Postmodernism** claims that there is no objective truth, rendering authentic love ordered toward anything "good" impossible. There is nothing good, no justice, no mercy, no truth.

All of these broken ideologies have led to the fragmentation of society and the breakdown of the family:

- **Divorce**: literally breaks up the unity of the family and devastates the Children who then learn from this broken example of love and live that out.
- **Abortion**: literally murders innocent babies for the sake of convenience and selfishness.
- **Gay marriage**: distorts the model of what marriage is - a union between a man and a woman ordered toward the procreation of children.
- **Transgenderism**: teaches children that they were not made in God's image - they can define their own self. Pulls the rug out from under the family and the children's understanding of what love is.

When evangelizing or discussing contemporary issues, we can explain that the Catholic vision offers a more complete alternative:

1. **On human dignity**: Catholic teaching upholds the inherent worth of every person from conception to natural death, not because of the color of their skin, what they do or contribute, but because they are created in God's image. All discussions of justice and mercy must start with this premise!

2. **On social justice**: Catholic teaching pursues justice grounded in truth and tempered by mercy, recognizing that authentic justice establishes right relationships for all rather than merely redistributing power, wealth, or status. It is never justice for you if it is not justice for your neighbor.

3. **On marriage and family**: Catholic teaching defends the covenant of marriage and the family as the domestic church where love, truth, justice, and mercy are first learned and lived. A healthy family is the foundation of a healthy society.

4. **On moral issues**: We uphold moral teachings not as arbitrary rules but as expressions of love that protect human dignity, establish justice and offer mercy - all according to God's perfect wisdom as has been revealed in Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition.

## Living This Vision in Daily Life

For us as practicing Catholics, this understanding of love transforms how we approach our daily lives:

### In Our Prayer Life

The integrated vision of love deepens our prayer beyond routine:

- In **Eucharistic Adoration**, we encounter Jesus Himself, the perfect unity of truth, love, justice, and mercy
- In the **Sacrament of Reconciliation**, we experience the perfect unity of justice and mercy
- In praying the **Rosary**, we contemplate how Mary's fiat ("Let it be done unto me according to your word") exemplifies sacrificial covenant love

### In Our Families

As the "domestic church," our families become schools of integrated love:

- Parents teach truth by their example and fidelity to Church teaching and participating in the sacraments.
- Family rules and discipline reflect justice that respects each person's dignity.
- Forgiveness within the family models mercy that heals rather than enables.
- Family prayer and attending Mass together fosters communion with God and each other.
- This gives parents direction on how to properly love their children. By learning and teaching the children how to balance justice, mercy and truth.
- We have a clear roadmap for helping our children "become saints". Teach them how to love.

### In Our Evangelization

When sharing our faith with others, this understanding of love provides a compelling message:

- When sharing with non-practicing Catholics, we can help teach them the beauty of the Catholic understanding of love.
- When sharing with non-Catholic Christians, we can help them understand that truth, justice and mercy are not just Christian values, but they are the foundation of all human dignity and flourishing. And that we can easily then show why "faith working through love" is what makes us Christian.
- When sharing with non-Christians, we can approach the discussion of God and religion from purely foundational principles of truth, justice and mercy which they probably already "believe in".
- Bottom line - lead with love - but know what love is...

### In Political Issues
- When addressing difficult moral issues, we have a framework to show how God's wisdom can be applied.  What is the truth of the matter?  What justice is required?  What mercy is needed? How should these be balanced for the good of all?
- When looking at political candidates, we can evaluate their policies and positions based on the principles of their understanding of God's truth, justice, and mercy.

## The Cross: Love's Perfect Expression

At the heart of our Catholic faith stands the Cross — Jesus' ultimate sacrifice as an expression of love as the perfect integration of truth, justice, and mercy. On Calvary, we see:

- The **truth** about sin's gravity and the punishment we deserve
- The **justice** that sin requires, fully satisfied
- The **mercy** that offers forgiveness and healing
- The **covenant** established in Christ's blood
- The **communion** made possible through His sacrifice

When we venerate the Cross or participate in the Mass, we enter into this mystery of integrated love. And when we carry our own crosses in union with Christ, we participate in His redemptive love.

This is what it means to pick up your cross and follow Jesus - to pick up the Cross of truth, justice, mercy and sacrifice and then live it out in your daily life. The more deeply we are able to do this, the more we become "salt of the earth and light of the world" (Matthew 5:13-14), joining Jesus in His mission of Salvation for the entire world.

## Practical Steps for Growth



Start by meditating on this definition: "Perfect love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant-binding truth, justice, and mercy into life-giving communion."

Memorize it, internalize it, be able to explain it.

As Catholics - Jesus' beautiful Church, led by the Holy Spirit, has given us so many beautiful gifts to experience the wisdom and love of God first hand!

1. **Pray the Mass**: Mass is our highest form of prayer. Learn about the why behind everything that is done at the Mass and what it has to teach you about God's love, truth, justice, and mercy.
2. **Liturgy of the Hours** - Pray the Liturgy of the Hours daily.  This is another form of prayer and immersing yourself in God's Word.  Pray with someone else to help grow in wisdom and understanding and to hold each other accountable.
3. **Receive the sacraments frequently**: Experience God's mercy first hand in the Sacraments of Reconciliation and His love in the Eucharist. Learn deeply what each Sacrament means in the Catholic understanding of love especially Holy Communion, Confession/Reconciliation/Penance and Holy Matrimony/Holy Orders.
4. **Study the faith**: Read Scripture, the Catechism, and Church documents on love and relationships. The Bible in a Year and The Catechism in a Year by Father Mike Schmitz are amazing gifts to our Faith.
5. **Build Catholic community**: Share this vision with fellow parishioners through Bible studies or faith-sharing groups
6. **Be part of the 'New Evangelization'**: Make evangelization (by living and sharing the Catholic understanding of love) a part of your daily life. ALWAYS in complete charity attempting to demonstrate the love of Christ, His truth, His justice and His mercy. An argument will only push people away.
    - in every conversation
    - in every action
    - in every decision
    - in every relationship
7. **Live the faith**: Live the faith in your daily life.  This is the most important step of all.  It is the most important step because it is the most important step.  It is the most important step because it is the most important step.
8. **Pray the rosary**: Pray the rosary daily.  This is another form of prayer and immersing yourself in God's Word.
9. **Learn Catholic Apologetics** - Learn to reason properly about the teachings of the Faith. This will help you to see both sides and understand the Catholic understanding of love much more clearly.
10. **Raise a good Catholic Family** - Raise a family that is a reflection of the Catholic understanding of love.
11. **Sends your Kids to faithful Catholic schools and universities**: A great resource for this is the Cardinal Newman Society - https://www.cardinalnewmansociety.org.


## Conclusion

As faithful Catholics in today's world, we possess a treasure in our Church's understanding of love as the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant-binding truth, justice, and mercy into life-giving communion. This integrated vision not only deepens our own faith but provides a compelling alternative to the fragmented understandings of love prevalent in our culture.

When we live and share this vision, we follow Christ's command to be "salt of the earth and light of the world" (Matthew 5:13-14). We offer not just critique but a positive vision—one that responds to the deepest longings of the human heart and provides a path toward authentic communion with God and neighbor.

In a world desperately seeking love but often looking in the wrong places, we as Catholics are called to be witnesses to love's true nature—not just in what we say, but in how we live. May our lives increasingly reflect this integrated love, drawing others to the One who is Love itself.
