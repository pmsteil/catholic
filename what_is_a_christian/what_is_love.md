# What is Love?

This question lies at the very heart of the Christian faith. Without understanding love - its divine source,
how it is revealed to us, and how we participate in it - we cannot truly grasp the meaning of Scripture, the
mission of the Church, or our own journey with Christ. Everything in our faith flows from and points back to
love: the Father's act of creation, Christ's sacrifice on the cross, the Holy Spirit's ongoing work in our lives,
the Church's sacraments and teachings, and our own call to holiness.

The diagram maps out love from its origin in God's perfect wisdom through its manifestation in grace to our
participation in it through virtue and sacrifice. This isn't just a theological framework - it's the key that
unlocks our understanding of salvation history, explains why Jesus came, and shows us how to live as children of God.
When we understand love in this complete way, the rest of our faith comes into focus: why we worship, why we need
the sacraments, why family life is sacred, and why every aspect of Catholic teaching ultimately serves to help us
know, receive, and share divine love.

This understanding of love has been the foundation of Western civilization, giving rise to unprecedented human
flourishing and freedom. It teaches us that true love requires both truth and mercy, justice and sacrifice -
essential principles for building a society that respects human dignity and promotes authentic human development.
As our culture loses this rich understanding of love, reducing it to mere sentiment or self-fulfillment,
we see the unraveling of the social fabric that has long sustained us. Only by recovering this complete
vision of love - rooted in God's wisdom and lived out in family and community - can we hope to rebuild
a civilization of love and truth.
