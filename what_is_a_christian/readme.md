# Book Plan

These are the three books I am planning to create for three different audiences based on answering the question:
"What is love?"

## Audience: For Catholics:

**Title:** *What is Love?: Recovering the Heart of the Gospel: Truth, Justice, and Mercy in Action*

**Bio/Pitch:** In a world that desperately needs God's love, are you seeking a more powerful way to live out your Catholic faith? This book explores the fundamental question, What is Love?, revealing the depth and richness of the Catholic understanding. Drawing on Scripture, the lives of the saints, and the teachings of the Church, you'll discover how every aspect of our faith is designed to teach us what Love truly is. This book helps inspire you to join Jesus in His Mission to Save the World through living out Truth, Justice, and Mercy in every aspect of your life.

## Audience: For Protestants:

**Title:** *Rediscovering the Heart of the Gospel: More than "Salvation": Building a Kingdom of Truth, Justice, and Mercy*

**Bio/Pitch:** Is there more to the Gospel than just "being saved"? This book challenges you to expand your understanding of God's love and His call to action. Discover how Truth, Justice, and Mercy are essential components of the Gospel message, empowering you to become an instrument of God's saving love, heal from the wounds of sin, and build a Kingdom that reflects His heart for the world. Explore everything the Bible says about Salvation and unlock a proper framing of what "faith alone" truly means: a faith encompassing the entire Gospel message—a complete commitment to following Him.

## Audience: Current Society and those on both sides of the political spectrum - left and right

**Title:** *America Yearns for a Just King: Wokeness vs. Trump*

**Subtitle:** *The Longing for a Lost America and the Search for Truth and Justice – A Path to Achieving Both*

**Bio/Pitch:** Why are so many Americans drawn to figures who promise strength and decisive action, even if they challenge traditional norms? "America Yearns for a Just King: Wokeness vs. Trump" delves into the cultural and political forces driving our nation's current divisions. It explores the deep longing for a lost sense of community, shared values, and national purpose, and examines how both "wokeness" and the Trump phenomenon represent competing – and ultimately inadequate – attempts to fulfill that yearning. Discover a path forward that transcends the current polarization and offers a vision for achieving both Truth and Justice in a way that honors our shared humanity.
