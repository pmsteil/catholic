Let's create an apolgetic work from a Catholic perspective to answer the question:

What is Love?

Start with a section on the anchor points of that most Christians still believe in:
- God is the Creator of the Universe.
- God is the Creator of all Truth.
- God is Love.
- Love is a gift of God.
- Love is a gift of God's grace.
- We are created in the image of God.


Add a section that shows what the Bible REQUIRES of us to love God with all our heart, soul, and mind. Add at least 10 examples for each category quoting the actual Bible verses using the NABRE translation.

Have sections for each of the following that break down the definition of love in these categories:
- love of God
- sacrifce
- obedience
- humility
- self-control
- selflessness

provide at least 10 examples for each category quoting the actual Bible verses using the NABRE translation.

Once we have determined what the Bible requires of us to love God with all our heart, soul, and mind, then we can move on to how to love our neighbor and ourselves.

And then a section to describe how sin relates to love and how sin prevents us from loving God, our neighbor, and ourselves
with all our heart, soul, and mind.  Give 10 bible quotes of how sin can affect our ability to love.

It should then speak of the sermon on the mount and how it relates to the greatest commandment.

It should then point out other teachings of Jesus that relate to the greatest commandment.

Then it should speak of the role of grace in love and how it relates to the greatest commandment.

Then it should speak of Faith and how it relates to the greatest commandment.  How Faith is Trust in God and
how Faith is the foundation of our relationship with God and that relationship teaches us how to love God and
neighbor and ourselves with all our heart, soul, and mind.

It should then argue that love requires both trust of God (faith) and an active commitment to do His will (works).
And show how these two are so intertwined that they are inseparable.

Then it should speak of the role of grace in love and how it relates to the greatest commandment.
