# BOOK PROPOSAL: CATHOLIC RULES FOR SOLA SCRIPTURA
## The Great Protestant Bible Contradiction

### CONCEPT SUMMARY
"Catholic Rules for Sola Scriptura" challenges the widespread misconception that Catholics don't prioritize Scripture by revealing how Catholic tradition has consistently preserved, venerated, and integrated the complete Bible more faithfully than Protestant traditions that claim to uphold "Scripture alone." This book exposes the untold story of how economic publishing decisions—not theological discernment—led to the removal of deuterocanonical books from Protestant Bibles, and demonstrates how these missing texts contain vital theological insights that significantly impact Christian understanding of salvation, virtue, and spiritual life.

### MARKET POSITION
This book addresses a gap in the religious publishing market by providing a fresh perspective on Catholic-Protestant dialogue that moves beyond defensive apologetics to a confident examination of historical facts and liturgical practices. It will appeal to:

- Catholics seeking to better understand and articulate their tradition's deep biblical roots
- Protestants interested in an honest historical account of biblical canon development
- Theology students and professors studying ecumenical dialogue
- Anyone interested in the history of Bible publication and its theological impacts

### UNIQUE SELLING POINTS
1. Reveals the largely unknown history of how deuterocanonical books were gradually removed from Protestant Bibles primarily through publishing decisions
2. Provides a side-by-side comparison of how deuterocanonical books address key theological concepts that differ between Catholic and Protestant traditions
3. Demonstrates through measurable metrics how Catholic liturgy incorporates more Scripture than typical Protestant worship services
4. Examines the various, often contradictory definitions of "Sola Scriptura" across Protestant denominations
