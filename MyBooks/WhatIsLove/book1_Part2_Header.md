## PART II: THE FOUNDATION OF LOVE

> **The Source and Summit: Love Perfectly Integrated**
> Before we dive into the building blocks of love (dignity, truth, justice, mercy, faith), let's remember where we see them perfectly united: **the Holy Eucharist.** It is the ultimate **sacred, sacrificial gift** of the **New Covenant**, embodying God's **truth**, satisfying His **justice**, pouring out His **mercy**, and drawing us into **life-giving communion**. The Eucharist prefigures and fulfills everything we'll discuss in this section. It is Love made present. Keep the Mass at the center as we explore these foundations.
