description: Convert markdown blockquotes in this chapter to html blockquotes.
---

Use the the /blockquote-formatting workflow for the html syntax for blockquote formatting and apply this for these parts of this chapter:

1. Find all current markdown "blockquote" elements and convert them to our html blockquote formatting.
2. Find all other Bible verses and Author quotes that need to be converted to html blockquote formatting.
