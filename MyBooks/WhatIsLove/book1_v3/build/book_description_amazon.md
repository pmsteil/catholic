### We’ve lost touch with what love actually is.

“Love is love,” feelings-as-truth, and power politics promise freedom but leave us lonelier, angrier, and more divided. When love is severed from truth, it becomes sentimentality. When it is severed from mercy, justice turns cruel. Families fracture. Children suffer. Public life grows cynical.

### What if the answer isn’t a new ideology, but a Person—and the way He loves?

What Is Love? presents a clear Catholic vision of love that can heal hearts, renew families, and rebuild culture. Drawing on Scripture, the Catechism, the saints, and lived experience, Patrick Steil distills 2,000 years of wisdom into a concrete, memorable definition:

> “The sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant - binding truth, justice, and mercy - into life‑giving communion.”

This book shows why authentic love always unites God’s truth, God’s justice, and God’s mercy—and how Jesus reveals that unity most perfectly in the Cross and in the Holy Eucharist.

#### Why this matters now
- Clarity beats slogans: real love is more than feelings or power.
- Truth, justice, and mercy rise or fall together; separate them and people get hurt.
- Covenant love forms strong marriages and families—the foundation of a healthy society.
- The sacraments don’t just “symbolize” love; they give grace to live it.
