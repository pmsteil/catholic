# SOP — Final Edit Tasks (Comprehensive, Chapter-by-Chapter)

This checklist consolidates final editorial tasks to make the manuscript maximally accessible to everyday Catholics while preserving doctrinal depth. It reflects: quick-start accessibility, define-as-you-go, vignettes, pastoral notes on sensitive topics, consistent structure, CCC accuracy, and clean language. Scripture translation selection and standardization occur in the finalization step.

Use this document as a working SOP. Check off items as completed and keep notes inline.

## Tracking Notes

Use `[ ]` not started, `[✅]` complete beside each bullet as you work. Keep short notes inline (date/initials) when helpful.

---

## Global (applies to all chapters)

[ ] Scripture Translation: Defer translation selection and verification to the finalization step. Maintain placeholders where needed; do not lock chapter text to a specific translation yet.
[ ] Quick‑Start: Add a 2‑page “Start Here” insert (definition, one diagram, 5 daily practices, 7-day examen) placed after `3_introduction.md` in build order; link it from the TOC.
[ ] Visual Map: Add a 1‑page diagram showing how truth–justice–mercy–sacrifice–covenant integrate in the Cross and Eucharist; reference once per Part.
[ ] Consistent Structure: Ensure each chapter ends with these sections (standardized headings):
  [ ] “Living the Response” (practical steps, 5–7 bullets)
  [ ] “Three Questions to Ask” (diagnostic, audience-facing)
  [ ] “Prayer Practice” (short prayer + weekly concrete practice)
  [ ] “Closing” (Chapter Takeaway: 1–2 sentences; Test Questions: 5 short Qs; Reflection Question: 1)
  [ ] “Further Study” (Scripture, Catechism, Saints; verify quotes and numbers)
[ ] CCC Citations: Check numbers, add paragraph ranges where applicable; add quotation marks and source labels consistently.
[ ] Define-as-you-go: On first use of key terms, add a brief inline definition and a link to Appendix 4 Definitions. Terms to watch: covenant, typology, Paschal Mystery, anamnesis, transubstantiation, substance/accidents, hypostatic union, sanctifying/actual grace, mortal/venial sin, magisterium, inerrancy/infallibility, natural law, relativism, scandal, detraction, sacrament (sign/effect, form/matter, minister), ex opere operato, communion, concupiscence.
[ ] Vignettes: Open each chapter with a 6–8 sentence concrete vignette that previews the chapter’s doctrine in daily life.
[ ] Pastoral Notes: Add a small “Pastoral Note” callout wherever topics could be experienced as personally sensitive (marriage, sexuality, gender, divorce, scrupulosity, scandal cases). Emphasize the justice/mercy of human dignity as defined by God, and hope and the solution to be found in God’s love, while acknowledging that the world is in such a bad place didn't happen overnight and will not be solved overnight... for example, the fact that our society has normalized divorce so that if one does get a divorce not realizing the damage that they are doing, we need to be patient and compassionate and help them to find a way to heal and move forward through the Sacraments and also to help them teach the next generation how not to make the same mistakes.
[ ] Language Pass: Reduce density, shorten long paragraphs, prefer concrete verbs/examples, remove repeated phrasing of the core definition where redundant.
[ ] Small‑Group Guide: Create a 10–12 week plan (readings, 3 discussion Qs, 1 practice, 1 prayer) in a new `study/` folder; link from Introduction and Conclusion.

## Core Chapters

### `chapter_01.md` — Evil
[ ] Fix duplicate heading: two “Sin: The Root of All Evil” sections; consolidate into one.
[ ] Add “Three Questions to Ask” tailored to personal examination of moral evil.
[ ] Add “Prayer Practice” (short prayer + 1 weekly action) as a distinct section.
[ ] Add “Closing” block: Chapter Takeaway, 5 Test Questions, 1 Reflection Question.
[ ] Define first use: moral vs natural evil, concupiscence, scandal; link to Appendix 4.
[ ] Defer Scripture phrasing verification to the finalization step; verify CCC citations now.
[ ] Streamline rhetoric in the opening (keep urgency; trim repetition).

#### Vignette (for approval)
- On a rushed morning, Mark snaps at his eight-year-old for spilling cereal, then fumes all the way to work about “a world gone mad.” At a red light he catches his reflection and feels the sting of his own harshness. He realizes the darkness he condemns “out there” is also in his heart. At lunch he texts an apology to his son and asks to talk after school. That evening he owns his anger, asks forgiveness, and together they plan better mornings. He sees evil as more than headlines; it’s the battle within that needs grace.

### `chapter_02.md` — God’s Perfect Love
[ ] Ensure the core definition appears once prominently; replace later repeats with links/anchors.
[ ] Add “Three Questions to Ask” focused on recognizing authentic love vs sentimentality.

[ ] Define “perfect” (teleios = complete), charity vs emotion, natural law; link to Appendix 4.
[ ] Add a brief vignette illustrating love integrating truth–justice–mercy in a family moment.
[ ] Verify CCC quotes

#### Vignette (for approval)
- Maria finds her teen daughter in tears over a friendship drama. The easy route would be to say whatever soothes, but Maria sits, asks for the whole truth, and gently corrects where her daughter was unfair. She keeps the boundary about phone time (justice), forgives the outburst (mercy), and hugs her tight (communion). Her daughter whispers, “Thanks for loving me even when I’m wrong.” Maria recognizes love isn’t just warm feelings—it’s truth, justice, and mercy held together in a faithful gift.

### `chapter_03.md` — Justice
[ ] Add a short opening vignette (e.g., workplace fairness or schoolyard scenario).
[ ] Add “Vices Against Justice” (injustice, partiality, cruelty, vengeance; include detraction/calumny notes if treated here or link to Truth)
[ ] Add “When Counterfeit Justice Fails” (ideology without truth/mercy; pastoral tone).
[ ] Add “Three Questions to Ask”, “Prayer Practice”, and “Closing”.
[ ] Define: natural law, rights/duties framing, common good, retributive vs restorative justice.
[ ] Verify citations (Rom 13; Mic 6:8; CCC 1931; social teaching references) and source text.
[ ] Trim length by merging overlapping subsections; keep strongest biblical exemplars.

#### Vignette (for approval)
- On the playground, a smaller boy is shoved off the slide. Children cry, “That’s not fair!” A teacher hears both sides, restores the turn order, and has the bigger kid help the smaller one climb. Later, the class awards a kindness sticker to the helper. The kids feel it: consequences were real, dignity was protected, and good was honored. Justice wasn’t vengeance; it set things right and taught everyone how to live together.

### `chapter_04.md` — Mercy
[ ] Add vices/opposites: cruelty, indifference, enabling (false mercy), resentment.
[ ] Add “When Counterfeit Mercy Fails” (mercy without truth/justice → enabling harm).
[ ] Add “Three Questions to Ask”, “Prayer Practice”, and “Closing”.
[ ] Define: forgiveness vs reconciliation, justice–mercy integration, restitution.

#### Vignette (for approval)
- After months of distance, James admits to his wife that he’d hidden credit card debt and lied out of fear. She feels the betrayal like a punch, but asks for the full truth and a plan. Together they call a counselor and agree on safeguards and a budget. She offers forgiveness—not to erase consequences, but to rebuild trust with hope. Mercy doesn’t make light of the wound; it opens space for real healing.

### `chapter_05.md` — Truth
[ ] Add vignette (difficult conversation with a friend/family member; truth in love).
[ ] Add vices/opposites: relativism, deceit, rash judgment, detraction/calumny, rigidity (truth without love).
[ ] Add “Counterfeits of Truth” (subjectivism, “my truth”, info‑overload without wisdom).
[ ] Add “Three Questions to Ask”, “Prayer Practice”, and “Closing”.
[ ] Define: magisterium, revelation (Scripture/Tradition), inerrancy vs infallibility, conscience formation.
[ ] Add CCC cross‑refs as used

#### Vignette (for approval)
- A college student, Tessa, wants to cohabit with her boyfriend to “test compatibility.” Her older sister, Ana, prays first, then invites coffee. Ana listens, names Tessa’s real fears, and shares why God’s plan protects love’s freedom and future. Tessa pushes back, but Ana refuses both shaming and silence; she offers concrete help to pursue engagement prep instead. Tessa leaves thoughtful, surprised by a truth that felt like care, not condemnation.

### `chapter_06.md` — Sacrifice
[ ] Add vignette (parental self‑giving; caregiving; hidden service).
[ ] Add vices/opposites: selfishness, acedia/sloth, performative “martyr complex” (counterfeit sacrifice).
[ ] Add “Three Questions to Ask”, “Prayer Practice”, and “Closing”.
[ ] Define: redemptive suffering, offering it up, participation in Christ’s sacrifice.
[ ] Verify Scriptural anchors and CCC on sacrifice/sanctification.

#### Vignette (for approval)
- Carlos, a delivery driver, picks up an extra shift so his wife can rest after a newborn’s long night. He misses the game, changes a diaper he’d rather avoid, and brings home cheap flowers and a smile. Exhausted, he still kneels by the bed to thank God for the chance to love. None of it trends online, but something inside grows stronger. Sacrifice hurts—and somehow makes room for joy.

### `chapter_07.md` — Covenant
[ ] Add vignette (keeping a difficult promise; fidelity in trial).
[ ] Add vices/opposites: infidelity, betrayal, transactional relationships.
[ ] Add “Three Questions to Ask”, “Prayer Practice”, and “Closing”.
[ ] Pastoral Notes: divorce/separation healing; SSA and chastity; accompaniment language.
[ ] Define: covenant vs contract, oath/swearing, family bond, New Covenant fulfillment.
[ ] Verify references; ensure marriage material aligns with Appendix B tone.

#### Vignette (for approval)
- After a brutal argument, Leah considers sleeping at her sister’s. The vows on their wedding photo catch her eye: “for better, for worse.” She texts her husband, “Can we try again—with help?” The next week they meet a mentor couple, apologize to the kids, and restart weekly prayer, even awkwardly. Covenant isn’t a feeling; it’s a faithful “yes” that calls grace into ordinary Tuesdays.

### `chapter_08.md` — The Sacraments
[ ] Add vignette (conversion through Confession/Eucharist; baptismal family scene).
[ ] Add “Three Questions to Ask”, “Prayer Practice”, and “Closing”.
[ ] Define: sign/effect, form/matter, minister; sanctifying vs actual grace; ex opere operato; dispositions.
[ ] Add simple visual/flow: sacraments as covenant life‑cycle (initiation, healing, service) and their love facets.
[ ] Verify Scripture/CCC anchors for each sacrament.

#### Vignette (for approval)
- Mateo, 16, hasn’t been to Confession in years. A talk at youth group nudges him to try. He stumbles through, hears words of absolution, and walks out lighter than he remembers is possible. Sunday, he watches his baby cousin’s Baptism and realizes: God’s love meets us in real, embodied signs. The sacraments aren’t ceremonies; they’re how God builds a life with us.

### `chapter_09.md` — The Cross and Resurrection
[ ] Add vignette (forgiveness under injustice; hope amid grief).
[ ] Add “Three Questions to Ask”, “Prayer Practice”, and “Closing”.
[ ] Ensure unity: death–resurrection as one Paschal Mystery; highlight participation in daily life.
[ ] Define: Paschal Mystery, atonement in Catholic key (not penal substitution caricatures), theosis/divinization.
[ ] Verify citations and harmonize language with Sacrifice and Eucharist chapters.

#### Vignette (for approval)
- When Angela’s biopsy returns malignant, fear floods the house. She gathers the family and says, “We will carry this with Jesus.” Chemo days become rosary rides; neighbors bring meals; forgiveness flows more quickly in small squabbles. On Easter, with a scarf on her head, she sings “Alleluia” with tears. The Cross didn’t vanish—but Resurrection hope changed how they walked it.

### `chapter_10.md` — The Eucharist (Perfect Love Made Present)
[ ] Add pastoral “I struggle to believe” note with next steps (adoration, mystagogy, witnesses).
[ ] Add “Three Questions to Ask”, “Prayer Practice”, and “Closing”.
[ ] Define: Real Presence, transubstantiation (substance/accidents), anamnesis, sacrifice‑communion, worthy reception.
[ ] Add simple timeline/flow: Last Supper → Cross → Resurrection → Mass → Mission.
[ ] Verify CCC/Trent references now

#### Vignette (for approval)
- Liam, 14, thinks Mass is boring. During the elevation, he notices his dad’s eyes closed and his mom whispering, “My Lord and my God.” After Communion, they stay a minute longer in silence. That evening his dad explains, simply, “He’s really here—for us.” The next week Liam steps into Adoration with his youth group and feels a quiet he didn’t know he needed. The Eucharist moves from rule to relationship.

### `chapter_11.md` — Counterfeit Love (What Love Is Not)
[ ] Add summary matrix (bulleted) mapping counterfeits → which facet(s) they isolate/deny → pastoral response.
[ ] Add “Three Questions to Ask”, “Prayer Practice”, and “Closing”.
[ ] Strengthen pastoral notes: emphasize dignity, accompaniment, and gradualism of grace.
[ ] Define: scandal, cooperation with evil (formal/material), prudence in witness.
[ ] Verify Scripture/CCC used to evaluate counterfeits.

#### Vignette (for approval)
- Online, Kayla joins a cause that names real injustices and also seethes with contempt. She notices she’s angrier, less patient with her family. A friend asks, “Is this making you more loving?” That question won’t leave her. She keeps the passion for the poor but drops the bitterness, volunteering at the parish pantry instead. She learns counterfeits often start with a good desire—and end by rejecting the rest of love.

### `chapter_12.md` — Virtue and Growth
[ ] Add vignette (habit change; confession–communion rhythm; examen growth).
[ ] Add “Three Questions to Ask”, “Prayer Practice”, and “Closing”.
[ ] Define: theological/cardinal virtues, infused vs acquired virtue, vice/habit mechanics; cooperation with grace.
[ ] Ensure practical plan: habit loops, accountability, sacramental rhythm, spiritual direction.
[ ] Verify CCC anchors on virtue and grace.

#### Vignette (for approval)
- After a blunt comment wounds a coworker, Ben feels the old shame spiral. He decides on three habits: nightly examen, weekly Confession, and one deliberate act of kindness each day. He still stumbles, but he doesn’t quit. Over months, his tongue softens, his patience lengthens, and his joy quietly grows. Virtue looks like grace meeting practice, again and again.

### `chapter_13.md` — Mission/Conclusion
[ ] Add focused call‑to‑mission vignette (parish/family transformation story arc).
[ ] Add “Three Questions to Ask”, “Prayer Practice”, and “Closing”.
[ ] Link explicitly to Small‑Group Guide and Quick‑Start; include “Next 30 Days” checklist.
[ ] Add cross‑links to key chapters for ongoing study.

#### Vignette (for approval)
- The parish launches a simple initiative: a potluck for single neighbors and new immigrants. A nervous young mom brings store cookies; an elderly widower shares stories; a college kid leads games with toddlers. Someone asks why they’re doing this. The pastor smiles, “Because Love found us.” The night ends with exchanged phone numbers and real plans to meet again. Mission turns out to be love, organized.

### `chapter_14_summa_caritatis.md` — Summa Caritatis (Summary)
[ ] Align content with Quick‑Start: compress to a 1‑page “cheat sheet” view; cross‑link definitions.
[ ] Add a compact “Examen in One Minute” box.

#### Vignette (for approval)
- It’s Sunday: Mass in the morning, chores and laughter at home, a sibling spat resolved with apology and restitution, a visit to Grandma, and an evening prayer where each person names one way they gave and one way they’ll try tomorrow. No one’s perfect; everyone’s trying. Truth is spoken kindly, justice is practiced fairly, mercy is offered freely, sacrifice is chosen quietly, and covenant holds it all together. This is what love looks like, lived.
