# What Is Love?
Below is the outline for the book "What Is Love?".

**Book Purpose:**

This devotional book is at its highest purpose, the Catholic Answer to the Problem of Evil.  As CCC 25 and 309 tell us, the entire Christian Faith teaches us and is necessary to combat evil.  What's the solution to moral evil in the world? Answer is the perfect Love of God: revealed to us in the person of Jesus Christ.  The book also answers the question: "What is Love?" in a way that is both comprehensive and accessible to everyday Catholics for the purpose of combatting moral evil in the world starting in our own hearts. It is also a complete refutation of counterfeit forms of love (e.g., "faith alone" Christianity, marxism, wokeism, etc.) Our definition of what is love is a synthesis of all Catholic teaching in this one statement: "**Perfect Love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and true mercy into life-giving communion.**". This book explains what that means be breaking down every facet of love and to show that NONE of them can be addressed, talked about or practiced without understanding all the facets. This is exactly what Jesus meant when he said that to inherit eternal life we must love God with all our heart, soul, mind and strength and our neighbor as ourselves (Luke 10:25-28).  This is exactly why the Bible tells us there are many things "necessary" for salvation, because they are all facets of love. Faith is just one aspect of love - very important - God gives us the Grace to allow us, even while we are still sinners to turn to Him and say "I put my life in your hands" (trust) and then we spend the rest of our lives learning what His definition of love is so that we can "be perfect" as He is perfect. Everything the Church says and does (because it is the pillar and foundation of Truth) leads us to living our "faith" in love. The great "error" of protestantism is to try and separate "faith" from "love" and try to work out how to "have faith" without love. Council of Trent points out that this is impossible, they are not separable. This book explains why that is.

**Chapter Structure:**

For each chapter, there is a "Previous Chapter" column that indicates a previous chapter
outline that we previuosly generated for the chapter.  Use the previous chapter outline as a
reference for the new chapter's outline using the new chapter prompt. The previous chapter files
can be found in the "./book1_v2/outlines" directory. If no previous chapter outline has been
indicated, create the chapter from scratch.

## 🌱 Part 1: Introduction - What is Love?

*Where we intend to explain the high levels of what love is, where we lay out the traditional ways of describing love - "willing the good of the other" - and also the different forms of the Greek words for love (e.g., Eros, Philia, Storge, Agape), and culminate with our new, more comprehensive definition of love: **Perfect Love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and true mercy into life-giving communion.** This definition will be explored in every chapter.*

### Part 1 Chapters

#### Chapter 1: The Problem of Evil
- **Previous Chapter Reference:** 01
- **Facet of Love:** The Problem of Evil
- **Summary:** Confronts human-caused suffering; the "groaning" of creation (Romans 8:22, CCC 309). Establishes that moral evil is the fundamental problem requiring a solution, and that perfect love is the only adequate response. This chapter sets up the entire book by showing that every facet of love directly combats specific forms of evil.
- **Relation to Justice/Mercy:** Context for Justice and Mercy
- **Related Commandments:** Gen 4:1-16
- **Spiritual Practice:** Awareness of suffering
- **Vice to Overcome:** Indifference

**How Love Combats Evil:**
Each facet of love in this book directly confronts and conquers specific forms of evil:
- **Truth** conquers the evil of deception and lies
- **Justice** conquers the evil of oppression and exploitation
- **Mercy** conquers the evil of hardness of heart and revenge
- **Sacrifice** conquers the evil of selfishness and pride
- **Faith** conquers the evil of unbelief and despair

This is why perfect love—integrating all these facets—is the complete answer to the problem of evil.

> "Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses,
> let us rid ourselves of every burden and sin that clings to us
> and persevere in running the race that lies before us"
> — Hebrews 12:1

**The Journey Ahead:**

Having established our comprehensive definition of perfect love—"the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and true mercy into life-giving communion"—we now embark on a journey to understand how this love unfolds in every aspect of human existence. The remaining parts of this book will guide us through:

**Part 2: The Pillars of Love** - The essential tenets (Truth, Justice, Mercy, Sacrifice) that form love's foundation
**Part 3: The Virtues of Love** - How love expresses itself through the cardinal and theological virtues
**Part 4: The Fruits of Love** - The beautiful outcomes when authentic love is lived
**Part 5: The Communion of Love** - Love's ultimate fulfillment in union with God and neighbor

**Why We Reference the Saints:**

Throughout this journey, we will frequently reference the Saints—not as distant figures to admire from afar, but as our covenant family members who have walked this path before us. As members of the Mystical Body of Christ, we are bound together in an eternal covenant of love that transcends death itself. The Saints are our older brothers and sisters who have successfully integrated body, mind, and soul in perfect harmony with God's love.

They inspire us because they were human like us, faced similar struggles, and yet found ways to embody the very definition of love we are exploring. They teach us because their lives demonstrate that every facet of love—from truth and justice to mercy and sacrifice—can be lived authentically in real human circumstances. They encourage us because they prove that the path of perfect love, while challenging, is not only possible but leads to the deepest joy and fulfillment.

Most importantly, they intercede for us, praying that we too might discover how to integrate every aspect of our being—body, mind, and soul—into the sacred dance of covenant love that binds justice and mercy into life-giving communion.

As we proceed, let each Saint's example remind us that we are not alone in this journey. We are part of a great family, a covenant community that spans heaven and earth, all united in the one goal of learning to love as God loves.

### Part 2A: Pillars of Love — The Essential Tenets
*These are the core principles—Truth, Justice, Mercy, and Sacrifice—that form the very structure of authentic love. Even a child can grasp the importance of fairness (Justice), telling the truth (Truth), being kind (Mercy), and giving to others (Sacrifice). These tenets are not just abstract concepts but are lived realities that even the simplest heart can recognize as good and essential.*

> "There was a scholar of the law who stood up to test him and said,
> "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?" Jesus said to him,
> "What is written in the law? How do you read it?" He said in reply,
> "You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your being,
> with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself."
> He replied to him, "You have answered correctly; do this and you will live."

#### Chapter 11: Unity - The Integration of Body, Mind, and Soul
- **Previous Chapter Reference:** —
- **Facet of Love:** Unity - The Integration of Body, Mind, and Soul
- **Summary:** Explores how authentic love requires the harmonious integration of our entire human nature—body, mind, and soul—working together as one unified person. This chapter establishes that humans are not divided beings but an integrated unity where all three aspects must be in harmony for love to be authentic.
- **Relation to Justice/Mercy:** Both — Justice demands we honor the full dignity of human nature; Mercy heals the divisions within us
- **Related Commandments:** Mark 12:30 ("Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength"); 1 Thess 5:23
- **Spiritual Practice:** Integrated prayer (engaging body, mind, and soul); Examination of conscience across all three dimensions
- **Vice to Overcome:** Dualism; Compartmentalization; Suppression of any aspect of human nature
- **What Evil This Overcomes:** The evil of dualism that divides human nature against itself, leading to the suppression of the body (Gnosticism), the denial of the soul (materialism), or the neglect of the mind (anti-intellectualism). This division enables all forms of evil by preventing the complete person from responding to God's call to love.
- **Scriptural Anchor:** 1 Thess 5:23 ("May your spirit and soul and body be kept sound and blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.")

**The Catholic Understanding of Human Unity:**

The Catholic Church teaches that humans are not souls trapped in bodies, nor are we merely material beings with emergent consciousness. We are an integrated unity of body, mind, and soul—each aspect essential and none to be forsaken. This unity is so profound that when one aspect is wounded, the whole person suffers; when one aspect is healed, the whole person benefits.

**How Truth, Justice, Mercy, and Sacrifice Work Together:**

Just as body, mind, and soul must work in harmony, so too must the pillars of love work together:
- **Truth** engages the mind (understanding), the soul (spiritual discernment), and the body (lived witness)
- **Justice** requires mental clarity (knowing what is due), spiritual conviction (desiring what is right), and bodily action (doing what is just)
- **Mercy** flows from the soul's compassion, the mind's understanding of need, and the body's acts of kindness
- **Sacrifice** unites all three in the complete gift of self—mind, body, and soul offered in love

This integration is why authentic love cannot be reduced to mere feeling (soul), mere understanding (mind), or mere action (body). Perfect love requires the complete person, fully integrated and wholly given.

**Body-Mind-Soul Integration in Temperance:**

- **Body:** Honored through proper care, nourishment, and use according to God's design. The body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, not an enemy to be defeated.
- **Mind:** Engaged in understanding the proper ordering of desires and the reasons for moderation. Temperance requires wisdom and prudence.
- **Soul:** Oriented toward God as the ultimate good, finding its deepest satisfaction in divine love rather than created goods.

When these three work in harmony, we experience true freedom—not the slavery of disordered desires, nor the violence of suppression, but the joyful ordering of our entire being toward love.

**Related Sacrament(s):** All Seven Sacraments (as they engage the whole person—body, mind, and soul)
**Spiritual Practice(s):** Integrated prayer, Liturgy (engaging all senses and faculties), Examination of conscience across body-mind-soul dimensions
**Related Works of the Church:** Catechism on human dignity (CCC 362-368), Theology of the Body
**Relation to the Mass:** The entire Mass as embodied worship—kneeling, standing, speaking, singing, receiving—engaging our complete human nature in worship
**Related Saints:** St. Thomas Aquinas (integration of faith and reason), St. Francis of Assisi (embodied spirituality), St. Teresa of Ávila (mystical integration)

### Part 2B: Instinctive Responses of the Heart

*Where we explore the natural responses of the heart that are often intuitive and instinctive, even before we have a formal understanding of love. These are the responses that come from within, the intuitive sense of fairness, the natural inclination towards trust, and the simple recognition of kindness.

#### Chapter 19: Temperance
- **Previous Chapter Reference:** 28
- **Facet of Love:** Temperance - Harmonious Integration of Body, Mind, and Soul
- **Summary:** Explores temperance not as the suppression of bodily desires, but as the harmonious ordering of our entire human nature—body, mind, and soul—so that each serves its proper role in love.

- **Relation to Justice/Mercy:** Justice — ordering all aspects of human nature according to their proper dignity; Mercy — healing the wounds that cause disordered desires

- **Vice to Overcome:** Disordered desires; Dualism; Suppression of human nature
- **What Evil This Overcomes:** The evil of intemperance that enslaves us to disordered desires and the dualistic evil that divides human nature against itself. Gluttony, lust, and addiction destroy the harmony of body, mind, and soul. Temperance conquers the evil that would make us slaves to our appetites or enemies of our own bodies.
- **Scriptural Anchor:** 1 Cor 9:25

> "Athletes exercise self-control in all things; they do it to receive a perishable wreath,
> but we an imperishable one."
> — 1 Corinthians 9:25

**The Catholic Understanding of Temperance:**

Temperance is not about rejecting the body or suppressing natural desires, but about bringing our entire human nature—body, mind, and soul—into proper harmony. The body is good (created by God), the mind is good (made in God's image), and the soul is good (breathed by God). Temperance helps these three aspects work together as God intended.

**Body-Mind-Soul Integration in Temperance:**

- **Body:** Honored through proper care, nourishment, and use according to God's design. The body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, not an enemy to be defeated.
- **Mind:** Engaged in understanding the proper ordering of desires and the reasons for moderation. Temperance requires wisdom and prudence.
- **Soul:** Oriented toward God as the ultimate good, finding its deepest satisfaction in divine love rather than created goods.

When these three work in harmony, we experience true freedom—not the slavery of disordered desires, nor the violence of suppression, but the joyful ordering of our entire being toward love.
