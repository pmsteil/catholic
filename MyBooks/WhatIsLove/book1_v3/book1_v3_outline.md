## 🌱 Part 1: Introduction - What is Love?

*Where we intend to explain the high levels of what love is, where we lay out the traditional ways of describing love - "willing the good of the other" - and also the different forms of the Greek words for love (e.g., Eros, Philia, Storge, Agape), and culminate with our new, more comprehensive definition of love: **Perfect Love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and true mercy into life-giving communion.** This definition will be explored in every chapter.*

## 🌱 Part 2: Love's Intuitive Foundations — Known by a Child's Heart

*Where we explore the foundational aspects of love that resonate deeply within the human spirit, often understood intuitively even by children, long before any formal doctrinal understanding. These are the truths written on our hearts, the innate sense of fairness, the natural inclination towards trust, and the simple recognition of kindness. This part delves into how these childlike intuitions form the bedrock of a mature, Christ-like love.*

> "Amen, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children,
> you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.
> Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven."
> — Matthew 18:3-4

> "They show that the demands of the law are written in their hearts,
> while their conscience also bears witness and their conflicting thoughts
> accuse or even defend them on the day when, according to my gospel,
> God will judge people's hidden works through Christ Jesus."
> — Romans 2:15

### Part 2A: Pillars of Love — The Essential Tenets

*These are the core principles—Truth, Justice, Mercy, and Sacrifice—that form the very structure of authentic love. Even a child can grasp the importance of fairness (Justice), telling the truth (Truth), being kind (Mercy), and giving to others (Sacrifice). These tenets are not just abstract concepts but are lived realities that even the simplest heart can recognize as good and essential.*

> "There was a scholar of the law who stood up to test him and said,
> "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?" Jesus said to him,
> "What is written in the law? How do you read it?" He said in reply,
> "You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your being,
> with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself."
> He replied to him, "You have answered correctly; do this and you will live."
> - Luke 10:25-28
