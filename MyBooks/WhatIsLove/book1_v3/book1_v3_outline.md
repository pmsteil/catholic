## 🌱 Part 1A: Pillars of Love — The Essential Tenets

> “There was a scholar of the law who stood up to test him and said,
> “Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” Jesus said to him,
> “What is written in the law? How do you read it?” He said in reply,
> “You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your being,
> with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.”
> He replied to him, “You have answered correctly; do this and you will live.”
> - Luke 10:25-28

> For you were called for freedom, brothers. But do not use this freedom as
> an opportunity for the flesh; rather, serve one another through love.
> For the whole law is fulfilled in one statement, namely,
> “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”

*Truths from which all other virtues flow*

> He called a child over, placed it in their midst, and said,
> “Amen, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children,
> you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.
> Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.”
> — Matthew 18:2-4

## 🌸 Part 3: Fruits of a Love Made Mature

*Signs that love has taken root*

> “Now the works of the flesh are obvious: immorality, impurity, licentiousness,
> idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, rivalry, jealousy, outbursts of fury, acts of selfishness,
> dissensions, factions, occasions of envy, drinking bouts, orgies, and the like.
> I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things
> will not inherit the kingdom of God.
> In contrast, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
> generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.
> Against such there is no law."
> — Galatians 5:22–23
