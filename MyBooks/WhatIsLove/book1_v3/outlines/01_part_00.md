# Part 1 Summary: Introduction - What is Love?

Part 1 of this devotional, "Introduction - What is Love?", lays the essential groundwork for understanding the profound nature of authentic love as the ultimate answer to the human condition, particularly the pervasive problem of evil and suffering. It begins by acknowledging the "groaning" of creation ([`Romans 8:22`](book1_v3/book1_v3_outline.md:16)) in Chapter 1, exploring the deep-seated human experience of suffering and an innate longing for something more. This sets the stage for understanding why a true, robust definition of love is so desperately needed. The subsequent chapters delve into the universal cries that echo from every human heart: the cry for love itself ([`1 Cor 13:2`](book1_v3/book1_v3_outline.md:17)) in Chapter 2, the cry for justice ([`Isaiah 1:17`](book1_v3/book1_v3_outline.md:18)) in Chapter 3, and the cry for mercy ([`Luke 6:36`](book1_v3/book1_v3_outline.md:19)) in Chapter 4. These chapters collectively demonstrate that the problem of evil—the suffering and brokenness we witness and experience—stems fundamentally from a misunderstanding or absence of true love, which inherently encompasses both justice and mercy.

This introductory part culminates in Chapter 5 by moving beyond common or incomplete notions of love. It examines traditional understandings and then introduces the book's comprehensive definition: **Perfect Love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and true mercy into life-giving communion.** This definition, echoing the truth that "God is love" ([`1 John 4:8,16`](book1_v3/book1_v3_outline.md:20)), posits that the agape charity of our faith—a love that is sacrificial, covenantal, and unites divine justice with divine mercy—is not merely an ideal, but the practical and powerful solution to the problem of evil. By understanding and striving to live out this multifaceted love, we begin to heal the brokenness within and around us, transforming our "groaning" into a song of hope and redemption. The chapters of Part 1, therefore, guide the reader from recognizing the problem of suffering to discovering the foundational answer in the heart of God, which is Love.
