# Chapter 13: The Good News is God's Perfect Love

> "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."
> — John 3:16

> "God is love, and whoever remains in love remains in God and God in him."
> — 1 John 4:16

> "The whole concern of doctrine and its teaching must be directed to the love that never ends. Whether something is proposed for belief, for hope, or for action, the love of our Lord must always be made accessible, so that anyone can see that all the works of perfect Christian virtue spring from love and have no other objective than to arrive at love."

## The Greatest Story Ever Told

If you could know only one thing about the universe, about yourself, about the meaning of existence itself, it would be this: **God is perfect love, and He created you to share in that love forever.**

This is the Good News—not just a nice religious idea, but the fundamental reality that explains everything: why you exist, why you long for love, why evil hurts so deeply, why nothing in this world fully satisfies, and why your heart was made for something infinite and eternal.

The story begins before time itself, in the eternal communion of the Trinity—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—living in perfect love. This love is not a feeling or emotion, but the very essence of God's being. It is **perfect love**: the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and true mercy into life-giving communion. The Father eternally gives Himself completely to the Son, the Son eternally gives Himself completely to the Father, and their mutual love is so real, so personal, that He is the Holy Spirit—the Third Person of the Trinity.

This divine love is not contained or selfish. Perfect love overflows, creates, gives life. And so God, in His infinite goodness, chose to create the universe as an act of pure love—not because He needed anything, but because love desires to share itself. He created you, specifically you, in His own image and likeness, with the capacity to know Him, love Him, and share in His eternal happiness.

## The Image of God: Your True Identity

You are not an accident of evolution or a random collection of atoms. You are made in the image of God (Genesis 1:27), which means you carry within your very being a reflection of divine love. This is why you hunger for truth—because God is Truth. This is why you cry out for justice—because God is Justice. This is why you long for mercy—because God is Mercy. This is why you need authentic relationships—because God is perfect Communion.

Your body, mind, and soul were created to work in harmony, each aspect reflecting God's love in its own way. Your body was made for sacred relationship, not mere pleasure. Your mind was made to know truth, not just accumulate information. Your soul was made for eternal communion with God, not temporary satisfaction with created things.

This is your true dignity: you are a beloved child of God, created for eternal happiness, called to participate in divine love itself. No earthly success or failure, no human praise or criticism, no circumstance of life can change this fundamental truth about who you are.

## The Problem: Sin and the Slavery of Lesser Loves

But something went wrong. The first humans, Adam and Eve, chose to doubt God's love and seek their own way. They chose a lesser good—the fruit of the tree—over the Supreme Good—trusting relationship with God. This original sin damaged human nature, not by destroying the image of God within us, but by disordering our loves.

Now, instead of loving God first and all other things in proper relationship to Him, we tend to make created things into gods. We worship career over family, pleasure over purity, convenience over life, self over service. We seek our ultimate happiness in things that cannot provide it—money, power, sexual pleasure, human approval, entertainment, comfort.

This is the slavery of sin: being controlled by disordered loves, seeking our ultimate good in things that are only penultimate goods. And because our hearts were made for the infinite, nothing finite can satisfy us. We become addicted to more—more pleasure, more success, more control, more stuff—but we're never fulfilled because we're seeking infinite satisfaction from finite things.

Worse, when we make lesser things into ultimate things, we inevitably hurt others. The man who makes career his god neglects his family. The woman who makes pleasure her god uses others for gratification. The society that makes comfort its god kills inconvenient children and elderly. The culture that makes individual autonomy its god destroys the bonds of marriage, family, and community.

This is why evil exists in the world: not because God created it, but because rational creatures with free will choose lesser goods over the Supreme Good, and these disordered choices create suffering for themselves and others.

## The Solution: God's Perfect Love Incarnate

But God did not abandon us to our slavery. In the greatest act of love in human history, God the Father sent His Son to become one of us—fully God and fully man—to rescue us from sin and restore us to divine love.

Jesus Christ is perfect love incarnate. In His life, He showed us what authentic love looks like: truth spoken with compassion, justice tempered with mercy, sacrifice offered freely, covenant faithfulness maintained even unto death. He lived the perfect integration of body, mind, and soul—fully human yet without sin.

But Jesus didn't come just to be a good example. He came to do what we could not do for ourselves: to pay the price of our sins and open the way back to the Father.

### The Last Supper: Love's Greatest Gift

At the Last Supper, Jesus gave us the Eucharist—His own Body and Blood under the appearance of bread and wine. This wasn't just a symbolic gesture but the beginning of His sacrifice, the moment when He gave us everything He had and everything He was. In the Eucharist, Jesus makes Himself our food, our life, our strength for the journey home to the Father.

The Eucharist reveals the depth of God's love: He doesn't just tell us He loves us, He gives us Himself. He doesn't just forgive our sins from a distance, He comes to dwell within us. He doesn't just promise us eternal life, He begins to live that life in us right now through His sacramental presence.

### The Cross: Justice and Mercy United

On the Cross, Jesus took upon Himself all the consequences of human sin—not just the punishment we deserved, but the separation from God that sin creates. For the first and only time in all eternity, the Son experienced separation from the Father, crying out "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Matthew 27:46).

This wasn't divine child abuse or cosmic injustice. This was perfect love choosing to pay the price that justice demanded while offering the mercy that our hearts needed. Jesus, who knew no sin, became sin for us so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him (2 Corinthians 5:21).

On the Cross, perfect justice and perfect mercy kissed. God's justice was satisfied because the debt of sin was fully paid. God's mercy was revealed because He Himself paid the debt we could never pay. The Cross shows us that God's love is not sentimental tolerance of sin, but costly grace that takes sin seriously enough to die for it.

### The Resurrection: Death Defeated, Life Restored

But the story doesn't end with death. On the third day, Jesus rose from the dead, proving that His sacrifice was accepted by the Father and that death itself has been conquered. The Resurrection is God's "Yes!" to Jesus' perfect offering of love, and His promise that all who unite themselves to Christ will share in His victory over sin and death.

The Resurrection reveals that God's love is stronger than death, that His mercy is more powerful than our sin, that His grace can transform any heart that opens to receive it. It is the guarantee that our deepest longing—for love that never ends, never disappoints, never fails—will be fulfilled in Him.

## The New Covenant: God's Law of Love

Through His death and resurrection, Jesus established a New Covenant—not a contract based on our performance, but a relationship based on His grace. In this covenant, God writes His law of love on our hearts through the Holy Spirit, enabling us to love as He loves.

This law of love is not a burden but a liberation. When we live according to God's design for human flourishing—when we order our loves properly, putting God first and loving all other things in relationship to Him—we discover the freedom, joy, and peace our hearts were made for.

The law of love calls us to:
- **Truth**: Seeing reality as God sees it and aligning our lives with what is genuinely good
- **Justice**: Giving each person what they are owed according to their dignity as image-bearers of God
- **Mercy**: Responding to human frailty with healing and forgiveness rather than condemnation
- **Sacrifice**: Choosing the good of others over our own immediate gratification
- **Covenant**: Building faithful, permanent relationships that reflect God's faithfulness to us
- **Communion**: Growing in union with God and authentic fellowship with others

## The Sacraments: Grace for the Journey

God knows that we cannot live this law of love by willpower alone. We need His grace—His own divine life shared with us—to transform our disordered hearts and enable us to love authentically. This is why Jesus gave us the sacraments: concrete encounters with His grace that heal, strengthen, and sanctify us.

**Baptism** makes us God's adopted children, washing away original sin and giving us new life in Christ. **Confirmation** strengthens us with the Holy Spirit for our mission to witness to God's love. **The Eucharist** feeds us with Christ's own Body and Blood, making us one with Him and with each other. **Reconciliation** restores us to friendship with God when we fall into sin. **Anointing of the Sick** unites our suffering with Christ's redemptive passion. **Matrimony** creates a covenant of love that images God's love for His people. **Holy Orders** provides shepherds to guide us and ministers to serve us with Christ's own authority.

Through the sacraments, God doesn't just tell us about His love—He gives us His love. He doesn't just forgive us from a distance—He comes to dwell within us. He doesn't just promise us eternal life—He begins to live that life in us right now.

## The Call: Join Jesus in His Mission

Here is where the Good News becomes personal and urgent: God's love is not just for you to receive passively, but for you to participate in actively. Once you accept and submit to His truth, you become a servant of His law of love, called to join Jesus in His mission for the salvation of the world.

This is the most liberating truth of all: when you stop trying to save yourself and instead focus on loving God and serving His mission, you discover that your eternal destiny is secure in His hands. You no longer worry about whether you're good enough for heaven because you know that Jesus is good enough, and you are united to Him. You no longer fear death because you know that perfect love casts out fear (1 John 4:18).

Instead, you wake up each day asking: "How can I love God today? How can I serve His mission? How can I be His hands and feet and voice in a world that desperately needs to know His love?"

You become a living witness to the Good News—not perfect, but being perfected; not sinless, but forgiven; not self-sufficient, but dependent on grace; not earning God's love, but responding to the love He has already given you.

## The Promise: Perfect Love Forever

The Good News culminates in a promise that staggers the human heart: if you accept God's love and live in response to it, you will spend eternity in perfect communion with Perfect Love Himself.

Heaven is not just a place but a relationship—eternal participation in the divine love that is the Trinity. You will know as you are known, love as you are loved, and find in God the fulfillment of every authentic longing your heart has ever had.

But this eternal life begins now. Every time you choose truth over lies, justice over exploitation, mercy over revenge, sacrifice over selfishness, covenant over convenience, and communion over isolation, you are already living the life of heaven. Every time you receive the sacraments with faith, you are already tasting eternal life. Every time you love authentically, you are already participating in divine love.

## The Response: Gratitude, Humility, and Love

How do you respond to such Good News? With gratitude that overwhelms the heart, humility that recognizes your complete dependence on grace, and love that can't help but overflow to others.

You don't try to earn God's love—you can't. You don't try to deserve His mercy—you don't. You don't try to pay Him back—you couldn't if you tried. Instead, you simply receive His love with gratitude and let it transform you from the inside out.

You submit to His truth, not as a burden but as liberation from the lies that enslave. You embrace His justice, not as condemnation but as the foundation for authentic relationships. You accept His mercy, not as weakness but as the power that heals and restores. You offer sacrifice, not as payment but as the natural response of a heart that has been loved beyond measure.

You enter into covenant with Him, not as a contract but as a relationship of trust. You seek communion with Him, not as an obligation but as the deepest desire of your heart.

And in doing so, you become what you were always meant to be: a beloved child of God, living in freedom, growing in holiness, and sharing in the eternal love that is the source and destiny of all creation.

## Examen: Living in Response to Perfect Love

**Evening Reflection:**
1. How did I experience God's love today? In what ways did He show me His mercy, provide for my needs, or speak to my heart?
2. How did I respond to His love? Did I live in gratitude, humility, and service, or did I take His gifts for granted?
3. Where did I choose lesser loves over the Supreme Good? How did these choices affect my peace and my relationships?
4. How can I better join Jesus in His mission tomorrow? What specific acts of love, service, or witness is He calling me to?

**Daily Practice:** Before making any significant decision, ask yourself: "How does this choice serve God's mission of love? Will this draw me and others closer to Him or further away?"

**Act of Faith, Hope, and Love:** "My God, I believe in You because You are Truth itself. I hope in You because You are Mercy itself. I love You because You are Love itself, and You first loved me."
