### Key Relationships:

- **Everything flows from God's perfect nature** (Truth + Justice +
  Mercy)
- **Love is the human participation** in God's nature through grace
- **Working Good vs Working Evil** are the two fundamental human
  orientations
- **Grace enables, Faith receives, Salvation restores** our capacity for
  love
- **Vocation is how we express love** in our specific circumstances
- **Sacraments provide ongoing help** for righteous living
- **Repentance restores us** when we fall into working evil
- **Beauty emerges naturally** when love is perfectly expressed

## Foundational Definitions

<div id="truth" class="definition">

### TRUTH

Reality as God sees it; what actually is and what actually serves
others' genuine good. Truth is not subjective opinion but objective
reality that exists independently of our feelings or preferences. It
includes both factual accuracy and moral reality - what is right and
wrong according to God's eternal law.

<div class="examples">

**Examples:** A parent telling a child that stealing is wrong, even when
the child doesn't want to hear it. A doctor giving an accurate
diagnosis, even when it's difficult news. A friend speaking honestly
about harmful behavior, even when it risks the friendship. The Church
teaching moral truth, even when it's unpopular in the culture.

</div>

</div>

<div id="justice" class="definition">

### JUSTICE

Setting things right according to <span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('truth')">truth</span>; giving each person
what they are owed according to their dignity and circumstances. Justice
includes proper relationships, fair treatment, moral order, and
protecting the rights of all people, especially the vulnerable.

<div class="examples">

**Examples:** A judge sentencing a criminal with punishment that fits
the crime. Parents disciplining children fairly and consistently. An
employer paying workers a just wage for their labor. A government
protecting the rights of all citizens, especially the weak and
defenseless.

</div>

</div>

<div id="mercy" class="definition">

### MERCY

Compassionate response to need that goes beyond what
<span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('justice')">justice</span> requires;
healing, restoration, and patient forbearance with human weakness. Mercy
doesn't violate justice but transcends it with generous love, offering
forgiveness and second chances.

<div class="examples">

**Examples:** A parent forgiving a child who has genuinely repented of
wrongdoing. A victim choosing to forgive their offender and work for
their rehabilitation. A teacher giving extra help to a struggling
student. God offering forgiveness to sinners through the sacraments.

</div>

</div>

<div id="sacrifice" class="definition">

### SACRIFICE

The sacred, costly gift of self for the good of another; giving up
something valuable for the sake of love. Sacrifice is what makes love
concrete and real - it's the moment when love stops being just words or
feelings and becomes action that costs us something.

<div class="examples">

**Examples:** Parents losing sleep to care for a sick child. A soldier
risking his life to protect civilians. A spouse working extra hours to
support the family. Christ giving His life on the Cross for our
salvation. A priest taking vows of celibacy to serve God's people.

</div>

</div>

<div id="truth-justice-mercy" class="definition">

### TRUTH + JUSTICE + MERCY (INTEGRATED)

The three inseparable divine attributes that must be held together and
expressed through <span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('sacrifice')">sacrifice</span> for
<span class="term-link" onclick="scrollToDefinition('love')">love</span>
to exist. These cannot violate each other and must all be present for
authentic love.

<div class="examples">

**Examples of proper integration:** A judge sentencing a criminal with
appropriate punishment (justice) while ensuring the sentence fits the
actual crime (truth) and includes opportunities for rehabilitation
(mercy). A parent disciplining a child by addressing the real behavior
problem (truth) with fair consequences (justice) delivered with patience
and explanation (mercy).

**Examples of dangerous separation:** Truth without mercy = harsh
legalism that crushes people with unrealistic demands. Justice without
truth = arbitrary punishment based on false accusations or popular
opinion. Mercy without justice = enabling harmful behavior by refusing
to address real problems.

</div>

</div>

<div id="love" class="definition">

### LOVE (God's Perfect Love)

The sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant, binding
<span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('truth')">truth</span>,
<span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('justice')">justice</span>, and
<span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('mercy')">mercy</span> into life-giving
communion. Love is not an emotion but God's own nature expressed through
<span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('sacrifice')">sacrifice</span> for the good
of another, creating permanent bonds that generate and sustain life.

<div class="examples">

**Examples:** A mother staying awake all night caring for her sick
child, even when exhausted. A businessman refusing to cheat customers
despite financial pressure, because it would harm them. A soldier
risking his life to save civilians, not for glory but because protecting
others is his duty. A priest taking vows of poverty and celibacy to
serve God's people without personal gain.

</div>

</div>

<div id="working-good" class="definition">

### WORKING GOOD (Righteousness)

Actively choosing to express complete <span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('truth-justice-mercy')">truth+justice+mercy</span>
for others' benefit at our own expense. This is our fundamental
<span class="term-link" onclick="scrollToDefinition('duty')">duty</span>
as creatures made in God's image. We can only do this through God's
<span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('grace')">grace</span>, but when we
cooperate with that grace, we are actually working good - like a soldier
serving his country out of duty, not for personal reward.

<div class="examples">

**Examples:** A teacher patiently explaining difficult concepts to
struggling students, even staying after hours without extra pay. Parents
waking up repeatedly during the night to care for a newborn, sacrificing
sleep for their child's welfare. A government official making unpopular
but necessary decisions for the common good, knowing it may cost them
politically. An employee working honestly even when supervisors aren't
watching, because integrity serves everyone better than cheating.

</div>

</div>

<div id="working-evil" class="definition">

### WORKING EVIL (Sin)

Actively choosing to work incomplete or perverted good (fractured
<span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('truth-justice-mercy')">truth+justice+mercy</span>)
for our own benefit at others' expense. This violates our created
purpose and breaks <span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('communion')">communion</span> with God and
neighbor.

<div class="examples">

**Examples:** A businessman lying about product quality to increase
profits, using partial truth to deceive customers. A parent being
permissive about harmful behavior to avoid conflict, showing false mercy
that damages the child's development. A judge showing favoritism to
wealthy defendants, perverting justice for personal or political gain.
Someone spreading gossip that contains some truth but lacks mercy and
damages relationships.

<div id="salvation" class="section">

## Salvation and Grace

<div id="grace" class="definition">

### GRACE

God's unmerited gift of His own divine life and power working within us,
making it possible for us to fulfill our created purpose of
<span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('working-good')">working good</span>.
Without grace, we can only work incomplete good for selfish purposes.
Grace heals our broken capacity to <span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('love')">love</span> truly, teaches us what
working good looks like, and empowers us to choose
<span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('righteous')">righteousness</span>.

<div class="examples">

**How grace works:** First, it heals our broken capacity to love truly.
Then it teaches us (through Christ, Scripture, and
<span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('church')">Church</span>) what working good
actually looks like in our specific circumstances. Finally, it empowers
us to choose righteousness out of <span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('duty')">duty</span> and love rather than
selfish calculation.

**Important distinction:** Grace doesn't do our choosing for us (we must
freely cooperate) but makes righteous choosing possible. Like a doctor
who heals our vision - we must still choose to look and see, but now we
actually can.

</div>

</div>

<div id="salvation" class="definition">

### SALVATION

God's complete healing of our capacity to <span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('working-good')">work good</span> through
His <span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('grace')">grace</span>. Not merely legal
forgiveness but actual restoration of our ability to fulfill our created
purpose of working <span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('truth-justice-mercy')">truth+justice+mercy</span>
for others. Like a skilled physician healing a broken limb - we are
actually made whole and able to function as designed.

<div class="examples">

**What salvation includes:** Healing from the damage
<span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('working-evil')">sin</span> has done to our
ability to love; teaching us how to work good through Scripture, Church,
and grace; empowering us to fulfill our duties righteously; and
restoring our <span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('communion')">communion</span> with God and
neighbor.

**What salvation is NOT:** A legal transaction that leaves us unchanged;
a license to live however we want; something we earn through good
behavior; or merely getting a ticket to heaven while remaining the same
person.

</div>

</div>

<div id="faith" class="definition">

### FAITH

Trusting dependence on God's gift of His perfect <span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('love')">love</span>
(<span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('truth-justice-mercy')">truth+justice+mercy</span>),
which heals us from <span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('working-evil')">working evil</span> and
enables us to <span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('working-good')">work good</span>. Faith is
not mere intellectual belief but complete reliance on God's power to
transform us. True faith is always accompanied by
<span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('righteous')">righteous works</span> - they
are inseparable aspects of the same reality.

<div class="examples">

**What faith includes:** Believing that God's way of love
(truth+justice+mercy) is truly good; trusting that God can and will heal
our capacity to work good; depending on God's teaching rather than our
own wisdom; and committing to live according to our created purpose
through actual working good for others.

**How faith works:** Like a patient trusting a surgeon - we believe the
doctor can heal us, we submit to the treatment process, and we follow
the rehabilitation by actually exercising the healed limb. Faith without
the "exercise" of <span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('good-works')">good works</span> is not true
faith, just as good works without faith are not truly good.

</div>

</div>

<div id="conversion" class="definition">

### CONVERSION

The fundamental turning from <span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('working-evil')">working evil</span>
(incomplete good for self) to <span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('working-good')">working good</span>
(complete <span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('truth-justice-mercy')">truth+justice+mercy</span>
for others). Not merely intellectual assent or emotional experience, but
a reorientation of the will toward fulfilling our created purpose
through faithful <span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('duty')">duty</span>. The moment when we
begin to depend on God's <span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('grace')">grace</span> rather than selfish
schemes.

<div class="fundamental-principle">

## The Fundamental Principle

Every human choice is either <span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('righteous')">righteousness</span>
(<span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('working-good')">working complete
good</span> for others through God's <span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('grace')">grace</span>) or
<span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('working-evil')">sin</span> (working
incomplete good for self). <span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('salvation')">Salvation</span> heals our
capacity for righteousness. Christian life is learning to fulfill this
capacity through faithful <span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('duty')">duty</span> in our God-given
<span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('vocation')">vocation</span>.
<span class="term-link"
onclick="scrollToDefinition('faith')">Faith</span> and works are
inseparable aspects of this grace-enabled life of
