# Chapter 2: The Universal Cry for Love
## Defining Love: More Than a Feeling

*"If I have all faith so as to remove mountains but do not have love, I am nothing."*
— 1 Corinthians 13:2

*"The desire for God is written in the human heart, because man is created by God and for God; and God never ceases to draw man to himself."*
— Catechism of the Catholic Church 27

*"Man cannot live without love. He remains a being that is incomprehensible for himself, his life is senseless, if love is not revealed to him, if he does not encounter love, if he does not experience it and make it his own, if he does not participate intimately in it."*
— Pope St. John Paul II, *Redemptor Hominis* 10

*"The whole concern of doctrine and its teaching must be directed to the love that never ends. Whether something is proposed for belief, for hope, or for action, the love of our Lord must always be made accessible, so that anyone can see that all the works of perfect Christian virtue spring from love and have no other objective than to arrive at love."*
— Catechism of the Catholic Church 25

## The Hunger That Drives Everything

Look around at the teenagers and young adults in our culture today, and you'll witness something heartbreaking. These beautiful young people carry a hunger so deep it's almost visible—they're desperate for love that is authentic, lasting, and transformative. But everywhere they turn, our society is feeding them counterfeits.

Our culture teaches young women that they must give their bodies away to be loved, that their worth is measured by their sexual desirability. Young men are told that commitment is optional, that "real men" avoid emotional vulnerability, and that conquest is more valuable than covenant. Children from broken homes often conclude that marriage is a joke and that promises are made to be broken. Meanwhile, social media and entertainment bombard them with messages that reduce love to feelings, pleasure, or personal fulfillment.

They are all hungry for authentic love, but our society has stripped them of any vocabulary for the real thing. This is the tragedy of our time: a generation starving for love while being fed poison.

This is the universal cry for love—the deepest longing of every human heart. And if we can't answer the question "What is love?" clearly and completely, we're failing the next generation just when they need us most.

## The Universal Experience of Longing

The cry for love isn't just a preference or a nice-to-have. It's written into the very fabric of our being—body, mind, and soul. This longing engages our entire nature, revealing that we are created for relationship at every level.

**The Body's Cry for Love:** Our bodies are designed for relationship. From the moment we're born, we need physical touch, comfort, and presence. Watch an infant reach for their mother's face, or observe how a child runs into their parent's arms after a nightmare. Our bodies literally recoil from isolation and thrive in loving presence. We're created for embrace, for gentle touch, for the physical comfort that says "you are not alone."

**The Mind's Cry for Love:** Our intellects hunger to be known and understood. We long for someone to "get" us—to see our thoughts, dreams, and ideas as valuable and worthy of attention. There's a special joy that comes when someone truly understands what we're trying to communicate, when they see the world through our eyes and appreciate the unique way we think and process reality.

**The Soul's Cry for Love:** At the deepest level, our souls hunger for unconditional acceptance and eternal commitment. The soul knows instinctively that human love, however beautiful, points beyond itself to something perfect and permanent. The deepest cry of the soul is for the love that will never end, never disappoint, and never fail—the love that can only come from God Himself.

When these three dimensions work in harmony, we seek authentic love that honors the whole person. When they're disordered, we either become purely physical (using bodies without engaging hearts), coldly intellectual (analyzing love without experiencing it), or unrealistically spiritual (expecting perfection from imperfect human beings).

## Why This Longing is Universal: Made in the Image of God

This universal longing for love isn't accidental or merely cultural—it's written into our very nature because we are made in the image of God. As Scripture reveals in the very first chapter of Genesis: *"So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them"* (Genesis 1:27).

**The Church's Beautiful Teaching**

The Second Vatican Council taught us something profound about what this means: *"Man is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, and he cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself"* (Gaudium et Spes 24). Think about that—you are the only creature God created not as a means to some other end, but as an end in yourself. You have absolute dignity and infinite worth simply because you exist.

Pope St. John Paul II, in his revolutionary "Theology of the Body," explained why this matters for love: *"Being made in the image of God means that the human being is capable of and called to love. The human being is created to love and to be loved."* As he taught: *"Man cannot live without love. He remains a being that is incomprehensible for himself, his life is senseless, if love is not revealed to him."*

**What Makes Us Different**

Being made in God's image means we share certain qualities that make us fundamentally different from all other creatures:

- **We can think and reason** about truth, beauty, and goodness—not just react to stimuli
- **We can choose freely** between good and evil—we're not slaves to instinct or programming
- **We can love authentically**—entering into real relationships of self-gift and communion
- **We have moral responsibility**—we can distinguish right from wrong and be held accountable
- **We're made for eternity**—our souls are immortal, destined for eternal communion with God

This is why a dog can be trained to sit, but only a human can understand why honesty is good and lying is wrong. This is why animals follow instincts, but humans can choose to fast for a good cause or sacrifice for others. This is why we don't put animals on trial—only beings made in God's image can truly choose between good and evil.

**Why This Changes Everything**

Understanding that every human being—without exception—bears the image of God means:

- **Every person has absolute dignity and infinite worth**—not because of what they can do, but because of who they are
- **Human life is sacred from conception to natural death**—the image of God doesn't depend on age, ability, or usefulness
- **We can never treat people as mere objects**—every person is a subject worthy of love, respect, and protection
- **True equality is grounded in our shared divine image**—not in human laws or social conventions
- **Love must honor the whole person**—body, mind, and soul created by God

This is why the cry for love is universal. Every human heart knows instinctively that we're made for something more than mere survival or pleasure. We're made for love because we're made in the image of Love Himself.

## What Children Know About Love

Before adult sophistication complicates everything, children express the cry for love with pure moral clarity. They understand truths about love that we often forget—and their entire being—body, mind, and soul—reflects whether they receive authentic love or not:

**Love is a fundamental truth of human beings.** Children's understanding of love requires no training in religion, philosophy, psychology, or any academic discipline. It needs no cultural conditioning or sophisticated education. This knowledge is written into human nature itself—part of what it means to be created in the image of God. Every child, in every culture, throughout all of history, demonstrates this same basic understanding of what love should be. Their pure hearts still carry the original blueprint of love because they haven't yet learned to suppress their deepest knowledge of human dignity.

**Love is the most important thing.** Ask any child what matters most, and they'll tell you it's being loved and loving others. They instinctively know that all the achievements, possessions, and accomplishments in the world mean nothing if you're not loved. When children witness cruelty or injustice, they are genuinely shocked. They haven't yet learned to rationalize evil or accept "that's just how the world works." Their outrage reveals that love demands justice and protection of the innocent. *Body:* Loved children stand tall, move freely, and embrace life with physical confidence. Unloved children often withdraw physically, hunch their shoulders, and carry tension in their bodies. *Mind:* Secure love frees a child's mind to explore, learn, and create. Without it, their minds become preoccupied with survival and safety. *Soul:* Love gives children a sense of worth and belonging that radiates from within. Its absence leaves them spiritually hungry and searching.

**Everyone needs love.** Children naturally assume that all people want to be loved and cared for. They don't yet understand the sophisticated arguments adults use to justify isolation or emotional walls. This universal expectation shows that the cry for love is written into human nature itself. *Body:* Children instinctively reach out physically to others, expecting embrace and comfort. When rejected, their bodies learn to recoil and protect. *Mind:* They assume others think and feel as they do—wanting connection and understanding. Repeated rejection teaches them to expect hostility instead of friendship. *Soul:* Children naturally see the good in others and expect to be seen as good themselves. Unlove teaches them to hide their true selves and view others with suspicion.

**Love should be forever.** Children expect love to be permanent and unconditional. At even the thought of divorce, children are devastated by the rupture of their family. When marriages break apart, children don't just adapt—they grieve deeply and often blame themselves. Their devastation reveals that they know, at the deepest level, that love should be permanent and that covenant relationships are meant to last. When parents break promises, children don't just feel sad—they feel betrayed. They instinctively know that love should be trustworthy and reliable. Their tears reveal that faithfulness is essential to love. *Body:* Stable love creates physical security—children sleep peacefully, eat well, and play freely. Broken love manifests in sleep disorders, eating problems, and nervous habits. *Mind:* Permanent love allows children to plan, dream, and trust the future. Broken promises create anxiety, hypervigilance, and difficulty concentrating. *Soul:* Faithful love teaches children that they are worth keeping. Abandonment wounds the soul with feelings of unworthiness and fear of commitment.

**Love means being together.** Children understand that love involves presence, time, and attention. They know that "I love you" means "I want to be with you" and "you matter enough for me to give you my time." When adults are too busy for them, children don't accept explanations about "quality time" versus "quantity time." They know that love means presence and availability. Their longing reveals that attention is a requirement of love, not a luxury. *Body:* Present love means physical availability—being there for hugs, comfort, and shared activities. Absent love leaves children reaching for empty air. *Mind:* Attentive love engages a child's thoughts, questions, and interests. Distracted love teaches children their minds don't matter. *Soul:* Presence communicates inherent worth—"you are important enough for my time." Absence whispers "you are not priority."

**Love makes you safe.** Children instinctively know that true love protects and provides security. They expect the people who love them to keep them safe from harm. This expectation of protection is so fundamental that children are confused when those who claim to love them fail to defend them from danger or are even the cause of it. *Body:* Protective love creates physical safety and security. Children relax, explore, and develop normally. Unprotected children live in hypervigilance, with stress affecting their physical development. *Mind:* Safety allows mental development and learning. Fear freezes cognitive growth and creates learning difficulties. *Soul:* Protection teaches children they are valuable and worth defending. Abandonment to danger teaches them they are expendable.

**Love is shown, not just said.** Children are remarkably good at recognizing authentic love through actions. They know the difference between words and deeds, between promises and follow-through. When they see hypocrisy, children are confused and hurt in ways that adults often aren't. They expect consistency between words and actions because they know that authentic love is truthful and integrated. *Body:* Consistent love creates physical trust—children relax in loving arms and respond to loving touch. Hypocrisy creates physical tension and withdrawal. *Mind:* Truthful love teaches children to trust their perceptions and think clearly. Deception confuses their minds and teaches them to doubt reality. *Soul:* Integrated love teaches children that truth and love go together. Hypocrisy wounds the soul by separating what should be united.

This childlike understanding—and their profound disappointment when love fails them—reveals that authentic love is written on the human heart as natural law. Their whole being—body, mind, and soul—responds to love's presence or absence because they instinctively recognize when the divine image within them is honored or violated. Their reactions reflect the essential nature of love: permanent, protective, sacrificial, forgiving, inclusive, and supremely valuable. If we want to truly and wonderfully honor what it means to be human, we need this fundamental clarity about what love truly is.

## Traditional Definitions and Their Limitations

Throughout history, various traditions have attempted to define love, each capturing important aspects while often missing the complete picture.

**Classical Philosophy** gave us helpful categories. Aristotle distinguished between eros (romantic love), philia (friendship), and storge (familial affection). Plato described love as the soul's journey from physical beauty to spiritual truth. The Stoics emphasized love as rational benevolence and duty toward others. These insights remain valuable, but they often separate what should be integrated.

**Christian Tradition** brought profound theological depth. St. Augustine taught that love is the ordering principle of all virtue: "Love God, and do what you will." St. Thomas Aquinas defined love as "willing the good of another"—emphasizing love as an act of the will directed toward another's benefit. St. John of the Cross explored love as union with God through purification and surrender. These definitions capture love's spiritual dimension but can sometimes feel abstract.

**Modern Attempts** have focused on different aspects. Romantic love emphasizes intense emotional attraction and passion. Humanitarian love stresses universal compassion and service. Psychological love focuses on healthy attachment and emotional bonding. Each captures something true but incomplete.

**The Problem with Partial Definitions:** While each traditional definition captures important aspects of love, they often fall short of the complete reality:

- **"Willing the good of another"** emphasizes love as an act of the will rather than mere emotion, but it can become cold duty without the warmth of mercy and personal relationship.

- **"God is love"** identifies love with the divine nature itself, but it can remain abstract without concrete application to human relationships.

- **"Love as sacrifice"** recognizes that authentic love requires costly self-giving, but it can become masochistic or enabling without proper boundaries and the guidance of justice.

What we need is a definition that integrates all these insights while avoiding their limitations.

## The Book's Comprehensive Definition

This book proposes a more integrated definition that captures all essential aspects of love:

**"Perfect Love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and true mercy into life-giving communion."**

This definition captures the fullness of love by including every essential element:

**Sacred:** Love participates in the divine nature and reflects God's own love. Because every human person is made in God's image, love is never merely human emotion or social convention, but a participation in the very life of God. When we love another person, we're honoring the divine image within them and expressing our own divine calling. As Pope Benedict XVI taught: *"Being made in the image of God means that the human being is capable of and called to love."* This sacred dimension means that every act of authentic love is simultaneously human and divine—we love with our human hearts, but we're participating in God's own love for His creation.

**Sacrificial:** Love requires costly self-giving and the willingness to suffer for another's good. It's not just feeling good about someone, but being willing to pay a price for their welfare.

**Gift:** Love is freely given, not earned or coerced. It flows from the freedom of the giver, not from the worthiness of the receiver.

**Covenant:** Love creates permanent, binding relationships ordered toward the good of others. It's not temporary or conditional, but establishes lasting bonds of mutual commitment.

**True Justice:** Love gives each person what they are due based on their dignity as image-bearers of God. It provides objective standards and prevents love from becoming mere sentiment.

**True Mercy:** Love goes beyond what is due, offering forgiveness and second chances. It provides compassion when justice alone would crush.

**Life-giving:** Love creates, nurtures, and sustains life in all its forms—physical, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual.

**Communion:** Love creates unity while respecting the distinct identity of each person. It brings people together without erasing their uniqueness.

## How This Definition Integrates All Aspects

This comprehensive definition avoids the errors of partial definitions by showing how the four essential pillars of love work in harmony:

**Truth** ensures love is authentic and based on reality, not illusion. Love must be grounded in what is actually good for the other person, not just what feels good or what they might want in the moment.

**Justice** gives love objective standards and prevents it from becoming mere sentiment. Love without justice becomes enabling, permissive, and ultimately harmful to those we claim to love.

**Mercy** provides love with compassion and forgiveness when justice alone would crush. Justice without mercy becomes harsh, legalistic, and ultimately destructive to relationships.

**Sacrifice** demonstrates love's authenticity through costly self-giving. Love without sacrifice is just sentiment; love with sacrifice proves its reality through action.

When all four pillars are present, love becomes perfect—capable of conquering all forms of evil and creating authentic communion between persons.

**Against Mere Sentiment:** The inclusion of justice provides objective standards that prevent love from becoming mere feeling or preference.

**Against Harsh Legalism:** The inclusion of mercy offers forgiveness and compassion that prevents love from becoming cold duty.

**Against Individualism:** The emphasis on covenant relationships and communion shows that love is fundamentally relational and community-building.

**Against Utilitarianism:** The recognition of the sacred dignity of each person prevents love from treating people as means to an end. Because every person is made in God's image and, as Vatican II teaches, "willed for itself" by God, we can never treat people as mere means to an end. The divine dignity inherent in every human being demands that love recognize each person as an end in themselves.

**Against Relativism:** Human dignity grounded in the image of God provides an objective foundation that transcends personal opinion or cultural preference. Love isn't whatever we decide it is—it must honor the reality of who we are as God's image-bearers. This is why we must know the truth about love: because love is truth for us, and truth is what sets us free to love authentically. As Jesus himself declared, "You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free" (John 8:32). This gives us solid ground for saying that some forms of "love" are actually counterfeits that deny or attack human dignity.

**Against Temporality:** The establishment of permanent covenant bonds shows that authentic love is not temporary or conditional.

## The Foundation for the Entire Book

This definition serves as the foundation for our entire exploration of love. Every subsequent chapter will unpack one aspect of this comprehensive definition, showing how each facet contributes to the complete response to evil.

The progression of the book follows logically from this definition:

- **Chapters 1-5** establish the problem of evil and introduce love as the solution
- **Chapters 6-15** explore the essential facets of love (truth, justice, mercy, sacrifice, unity, covenant, chastity, obedience)
- **Chapters 16-25** examine the heart's instinctive responses to love (faith, hope, charity, humility, and the cardinal virtues)
- **Chapters 26-39** show how love is lived through the disciplines and fruits of virtue
- **Chapters 40-42** reveal love's ultimate fulfillment in sacramental communion

Each chapter will demonstrate how that particular facet of love directly combats specific forms of evil, showing that perfect love—integrating all these elements—is indeed the complete answer to the problem of evil.

## Living the Response

Understanding what love truly is changes everything. It means we can no longer accept counterfeits—either in our own hearts or in the culture around us. It means we have a standard by which to measure every relationship, every choice, every commitment.

The saints understood this. St. Thérèse of Lisieux called love "the vocation which includes all others." St. John the Apostle, the beloved disciple, spent his final years proclaiming the simple truth: "God is love." St. Augustine built his entire theology on the foundation that love is the ordering principle of all virtue.

These saints didn't just understand love intellectually—they lived it. They allowed God's perfect love to transform their hearts, and through them, it transformed the world. This is our calling too: to understand love so deeply that it transforms us from the inside out, making us instruments of God's love in a world desperately hungry for the real thing.

*Heavenly Father, You are Love itself, and You have written the cry for love in every human heart. Help us to understand what love truly means—not the counterfeits the world offers, but the perfect love that flows from Your own divine nature. Give us the grace to live this love authentically, so that through us, others may encounter the love they're truly seeking. Through Christ our Lord, who is Love incarnate. Amen.*

## Examen: Recognizing the Cry for Love

**Reflection Questions:**
1. How do I see the cry for love manifesting in my own life—in my body, mind, and soul?
2. What counterfeits of love have I been tempted to accept or offer to others?
3. How does understanding love as "sacred, sacrificial, covenantal, just, merciful, and life-giving" challenge my current relationships?
4. Where do I see the pure understanding of love that children possess, and how can I return to that clarity?

**Daily Practice:** Each day this week, when you encounter someone (family member, coworker, stranger), try to recognize the cry for love in their words and actions. Ask yourself: "What is this person's heart truly longing for?" Then consider: "How can I respond with authentic love rather than a counterfeit?"

**Act of Contrition:** *My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart. In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good, I have sinned against You whom I should love above all things. I firmly intend, with Your grace, to do penance, to sin no more, and to avoid whatever leads me to sin. Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us. In His name, my God, have mercy. Amen.*

Understanding the universal cry for love is the first step toward becoming the kind of person who can satisfy that hunger in others. In the next chapter, we'll explore another universal cry that echoes through every human heart: the cry for justice. Together, these fundamental longings reveal the complete picture of what authentic love must include.
