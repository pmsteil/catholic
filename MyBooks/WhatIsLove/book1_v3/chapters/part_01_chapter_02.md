# Chapter 2: The Universal Cry for Love
## Defining Love: More Than a Feeling

*"If I have all faith so as to remove mountains but do not have love, I am nothing."*
— 1 Corinthians 13:2

*"The desire for God is written in the human heart, because man is created by God and for God; and God never ceases to draw man to himself."*
— Catechism of the Catholic Church 27

*"Man cannot live without love. He remains a being that is incomprehensible for himself, his life is senseless, if love is not revealed to him, if he does not encounter love, if he does not experience it and make it his own, if he does not participate intimately in it."*
— Pope St. John Paul II, *Redemptor Hominis* 10

*"The whole concern of doctrine and its teaching must be directed to the love that never ends. Whether something is proposed for belief, for hope, or for action, the love of our Lord must always be made accessible, so that anyone can see that all the works of perfect Christian virtue spring from love and have no other objective than to arrive at love."*
— Catechism of the Catholic Church 25

## The Hunger That Drives Everything

Look around at the teenagers and young adults in our culture today, and you'll witness something heartbreaking. These beautiful young people carry a hunger so deep it's almost visible—they're desperate for love that is authentic, lasting, and transformative. But everywhere they turn, our society is feeding them counterfeits.

Our culture teaches young women that they must give their bodies away to be loved, that their worth is measured by their sexual desirability. Young men are told that commitment is optional, that "real men" avoid emotional vulnerability, and that conquest is more valuable than covenant. Children from broken homes often conclude that marriage is a joke and that promises are made to be broken. Meanwhile, social media and entertainment bombard them with messages that reduce love to feelings, pleasure, or personal fulfillment.

They are all hungry for authentic love, but our society has stripped them of any vocabulary for the real thing. This is the tragedy of our time: a generation starving for love while being fed poison.

This is the universal cry for love—the deepest longing of every human heart. And if we can't answer the question "What is love?" - for the good of the children - clearly and completely, we're failing the next generation just when they need us most.

We also hear cries in our society today for justice and mercy, which we will address in subsequent chapters, but if we don't understand love correctly, we will be unequipped to help them find true justice and mercy—or to identify the counterfeit loves that keep our society in bondage to sin and deeper injustice.

## The Universal Experience of Longing

The cry for love isn't just a preference or a nice-to-have. It's written into the very fabric of our being—body, mind, and soul. This longing engages our entire nature, revealing that we are created for relationship at every level.

**The Body's Cry for Love:** Our bodies are designed for relationship. From the moment we're born, we need physical touch, comfort, and presence. Watch an infant reach for their mother's face, or observe how a child runs into their parent's arms after a nightmare. Our bodies literally recoil from isolation and thrive in loving presence. We're created for embrace, for gentle touch, for the physical comfort that says "you are not alone."

**The Mind's Cry for Love:** Our intellects hunger to be known and understood. We long for someone to "get" us—to see our thoughts, dreams, and ideas as valuable and worthy of attention. There's a special joy that comes when someone truly understands what we're trying to communicate, when they see the world through our eyes and appreciate the unique way we think and process reality.

**The Soul's Cry for Love:** At the deepest level, our souls hunger for unconditional acceptance and eternal commitment. The soul knows instinctively that human love, however beautiful, points beyond itself to something perfect and permanent. The deepest cry of the soul is for the love that will never end, never disappoint, and never fail—the love that can only come from God Himself.

When these three dimensions work in harmony, we seek authentic love that honors the whole person. When they're disordered, we either become purely physical (using bodies without engaging hearts), coldly intellectual (analyzing love without experiencing it), or unrealistically spiritual (expecting perfection from imperfect human beings).

## Why This Longing is Universal: Made in the Image of God

This universal longing for love isn't accidental or merely cultural—it's written into our very nature because we are made in the image of God. As Scripture reveals in the very first chapter of Genesis: *"So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them"* (Genesis 1:27).

The Second Vatican Council beautifully explains what this means: *"Man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself"* (Gaudium et Spes 24). We are the only creatures in our known universe that were not made for some useful "end"—yet paradoxically, we achieve our greatest dignity when we are willing to give away what and who we are for the good of others, following Christ's example of humble, obedient suffering for the love of the world.

Pope John Paul II, in his Theology of the Body, taught that being made in God's image means we are created with the capacity for love and called to love. As he explained, *"Man cannot live without love. He remains a being that is incomprehensible for himself, his life is senseless, if love is not revealed to him, if he does not encounter love, if he does not experience it and make it his own"* (Redemptor Hominis 10).

**What Makes Us Different**

Being made in God's image means we share certain qualities that make us fundamentally different from all other creatures:

- **We can think and reason** about truth, beauty, and goodness—not just react to stimuli
- **We can choose freely** between good and evil—we're not slaves to instinct or programming
- **We can love sacrificially**—putting another's good above our own immediate desires
- **We have moral responsibility**—we can be held accountable for our choices
- **We long for the infinite**—no finite good can fully satisfy us
- **We are called to communion**—designed for relationship with God and others

This is why a dog can be trained to sit, but only a human can understand why honesty is good and lying is wrong. This is why animals follow instincts, but humans can choose to fast for a good cause or sacrifice for others. This is why we don't put animals on trial—only beings made in God's image can truly choose between good and evil.

**Why This Changes Everything**

Understanding that every human being—without exception—bears the image of God means:

- **Every person has absolute dignity and infinite worth**—not because of what they can do, but because of who they are
- **Human life is sacred from conception to natural death**—the image of God doesn't depend on age, ability, or usefulness
- **We can never treat people as mere objects**—every person is a subject worthy of love, respect, and protection
- **True equality is grounded in our shared divine image**—not in human laws or social conventions
- **Love must honor the whole person**—body, mind, and soul created by God

This is why the cry for love is universal. Every human heart knows instinctively that we're made for something more than mere survival or pleasure. We're made for love because we're made in the image of Love Himself.

Now that we understand why this longing for love is written into our very nature as image-bearers of God, let's examine how great minds throughout history have attempted to define what love actually is.

## Traditional Definitions and Their Contributions

Throughout history, great minds and holy saints have offered profound insights into the nature of love, each contributing essential pieces to our understanding.

**Classical Philosophy** provided foundational categories that remain invaluable. Aristotle's distinction between eros (romantic love), philia (friendship), and storge (familial affection) helps us recognize love's different expressions. Plato's vision of love as the soul's journey from physical beauty to spiritual truth reveals love's transformative power. The Stoics' emphasis on love as rational benevolence shows us love's connection to virtue and duty. These insights form the bedrock of Western understanding.

**Christian Tradition** brought revolutionary depth through the saints and doctors of the Church. St. Augustine's teaching that love is the ordering principle of all virtue—"Love God, and do what you will"—reveals love as the foundation of moral life. St. Thomas Aquinas's definition of love as "willing the good of another" emphasizes love as an act of the will directed toward another's benefit, showing us that love is more than emotion. St. John of the Cross explored love as mystical union with God through purification and surrender, revealing love's ultimate destination. These saints gave us theological treasures that illuminate love's divine dimension.

**Modern Insights** have added valuable psychological and social understanding. Romantic love's emphasis on emotional attraction and passion shows us love's affective power. Humanitarian love's stress on universal compassion reveals love's social dimension. Psychological insights about healthy attachment help us understand love's developmental aspects. Each contribution adds to our understanding.

## The Heart of the Problem

After 37+ years of studying what Scripture means when it declares "God is Love" (1 John 4:8)—through theological study, seeking God's wisdom as a husband, father, and teacher of the Faith—I have witnessed something heartbreaking. Our culture, once founded by devout Christians who built churches in every town, now sees those same churches closing their doors. We hear passionate cries for justice that often oppose true justice, demands for sexual freedom alongside accusations that reveal the very injustices such "freedom" creates, and claims for human dignity that deny the fundamental truth of what it means to be human.

As a youth pastor, I watched good church kids absorb a culture that insists "there is no objective truth," while Christian denominations fragment over fundamental questions of love, marriage, and human dignity. In the midst of this confusion—where even sincere believers struggle to articulate what love actually means—I found myself longing for a definition of love that could unite us around the truth that sets us free.

This led me to wonder: is it possible to forge a more integrated definition that draws together all the teaching of our Lord through His Church? What we need is a definition that honors and integrates all these profound contributions while showing how they work together as one complete vision of the love God has for us.

## A Definition Forged from the Sacred Heart of Jesus for His People

After much prayer, study, and reflection, I offer this definition of love which attempts to draw together all of the myriad virtues and theological insights into a single, comprehensive understanding of love.

> **"Perfect love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and true mercy into life-giving communion."**

This definition captures the fullness of love by including every essential element:

**Sacred:** Love participates in the divine nature and reflects God's own love. Because every human person is made in God's image, love is never merely human emotion or social convention, but a participation in the very life of God. When we love another person, we're honoring the divine image within them and expressing our own divine calling. As Pope Benedict XVI taught: *"Being made in the image of God means that the human being is capable of and called to love."* This sacred dimension means that every act of authentic love is simultaneously human and divine—we love with our human hearts, but we're participating in God's own love for His creation.

**Sacrificial:** Love requires the costly gift of self for another's good. It's not mere sentiment but proven through action that costs something valuable. True love always involves laying down one's life in some way—whether literally or through daily acts of selflessness.

**Gift:** Love is freely given, not earned or demanded. It cannot be bought, manipulated, or coerced. Love that must be earned isn't love at all—it's a transaction. Love that can be demanded isn't love—it's slavery.

**Covenant:** Love creates permanent, binding relationships that endure through difficulties. It's not based on feelings or circumstances but on commitment and promise. Covenant love says "I will be faithful to you regardless of what happens."

**True Justice:** Love gives to our Creator and each person what they are due based on their dignity as image-bearers of God. It provides objective standards and prevents love from becoming mere sentiment.

**True Mercy:** Love goes beyond what is due, offering forgiveness and second chances. It provides compassion when justice alone would crush.

**Life-giving Communion:** Love creates authentic relationship and community. It builds up rather than tears down, unites rather than divides, and generates new life and hope. Communion is the "end" or fulfillment of love.

When all these elements are present together, love becomes perfect—capable of conquering all forms of evil and creating authentic communion between persons.

## Jesus' Call to Perfect Love

This comprehensive definition isn't merely human theological speculation—it directly reflects Jesus' own teaching about perfect love. In Matthew Chapter 5, Jesus gives us the most detailed description of what perfect love looks like in practice, culminating with His direct command: *"Be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect"* (Matthew 5:48).

### The Beatitudes: The Heart of Perfect Love

**The Beatitudes: The Heart of Perfect Love** (Matthew 5:3-12)
Jesus begins by describing those who live in perfect love: the poor in spirit who recognize their need for God (the sacred dimension), those who mourn over sin and injustice, the meek who don't demand their rights (the sacrificial gift), those who hunger for righteousness (living in God's true justice and true mercy), the merciful who forgive (true mercy), the pure in heart who see God (the sacred), the peacemakers who create life-giving communion as the family of God, and those willing to suffer for righteousness (sacrificial covenant that suffers for God's true justice and true mercy). Each beatitude reflects an aspect of perfect love.

### Salt and Light: Love's Mission

**Salt and Light: Love's Mission** (Matthew 5:13-16)
Perfect love doesn't hide but transforms the world: *"You are the light of the world... let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven."* This is life-giving communion in action—love that creates authentic relationships and draws others to God through the sacred gift of witness.

### Beyond External Compliance: Love's Interior Transformation

**Beyond External Compliance: Love's Interior Transformation** (Matthew 5:17-20)
Jesus came not to abolish the law but to fulfill it through love: *"Unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."* Perfect love goes beyond external compliance to interior transformation, binding true justice and true mercy together in the heart rather than merely following rules.

**Anger and Reconciliation: Love's Justice and Mercy** (Matthew 5:21-26)
Jesus teaches that perfect love doesn't harbor anger or contempt: *"Everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment."* Instead, love seeks reconciliation: *"First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift."* This perfectly demonstrates how true justice (addressing wrongs) and true mercy (seeking reconciliation) work together to create life-giving communion rather than division.

**Purity of Heart: Love's Sacred Nature** (Matthew 5:27-30)
Perfect love is pure in intention, not just action: *"Everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart."* This reveals love's sacred nature—honoring the divine dignity of every person even in our thoughts, treating others as the sacred image-bearers they are rather than objects for our use.

**Faithfulness: Love's Covenant Nature** (Matthew 5:31-32)
Jesus teaches that perfect love creates permanent, faithful relationships: marriage reflects God's own covenant faithfulness with His people. *"It was also said, 'Whoever divorces his wife must give her a bill of divorce.' 32 But I say to you, whoever divorces his wife (unless the marriage is unlawful) causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery."* This shows covenant love—permanent, binding relationships that endure through difficulties because they participate in God's own eternal faithfulness.

**Truthfulness: Love's Gift Nature** (Matthew 5:33-37)
Perfect love is truthful and trustworthy: *"Let what you say be simply 'Yes' or 'No.'"* This demonstrates love as gift—freely given truth without manipulation or deception, offered not because it's earned but because authentic love cannot coexist with falsehood.

**Generosity: Love's Sacrificial Nature** (Matthew 5:38-42)
Perfect love doesn't seek retaliation but gives generously: *"If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also... Give to the one who begs from you."* This is the sacrificial gift in action—costly self-giving that puts another's good above our own comfort or rights.

### Love for Enemies: Perfect Love's Ultimate Test

**Love for Enemies: Perfect Love's Ultimate Test** (Matthew 5:43-47)
The climax of Jesus' teaching: *"Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven."* This is perfect love in its fullness—the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant that extends true mercy even to those who hurt us, creating the possibility of life-giving communion where there was only enmity.

### The Command: "Be Perfect"

**The Command: "Be Perfect"** (Matthew 5:48)
Jesus concludes with the direct command: *"You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect."* This isn't a suggestion—it's a commandment. Jesus expects us to live this perfect love.

**How This is Actually Possible**
The beautiful truth is that the Catholic Faith provides the only framework that makes Jesus' command achievable. Through the Church's understanding of mortal and venial sin, we learn that "perfection" means living in a love relationship with God free from mortal sin—those grave sins that cause a deadly tear in our relationship with God. While we may still struggle with venial sins (which wound but don't destroy our relationship with God), we can indeed live the perfect love Jesus describes by avoiding mortal sin and growing in grace through the sacraments.

This means Jesus' command isn't impossible—it's an invitation to the life of perfect love that God makes available to us through His Church. The saints prove this is possible, having lived this perfect love while remaining fully human.

Jesus is calling us to a radical transformation of our hearts, a transformation that is only possible through the sacraments and the grace of God. And all that he calls us to live is precisely what our comprehensive definition describes: the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and true mercy into life-giving communion. Every teaching in Matthew 5—from the Beatitudes to loving enemies—reflects these exact elements working together as perfect love.

## What Children Know About Love

But we might wonder: is this understanding of love something we must learn through complex theological study, or is it natural to human beings? The answer comes from an unexpected source—children themselves.

Before adult sophistication complicates everything, children express the cry for love with pure moral clarity. Their reactions reveal that they instinctively understand the very facets of love that God has written on every human heart. This isn't coincidence—it's confirmation. Because children are made in God's image and haven't yet learned to suppress their natural understanding of love, they serve as living witnesses to the truth of our definition. Their profound disappointment when love fails to meet these standards reveals that this understanding is written on the human heart as natural law.

Jesus Himself affirmed this when He said, *"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it"* (Mark 10:14-15). Children naturally receive God's love because they haven't yet learned to complicate or rationalize it away. If we want to understand authentic love, we must recover the clarity that children possess before the world teaches them to accept counterfeits.

**Love is Sacred.** A child whose parents divorce doesn't just feel sad—they feel like something holy has been broken. They instinctively know that love between their parents should be treated as sacred, not disposable. When adults joke crudely about love or marriage, children recoil because they recognize love deserves reverence.

**Love is Sacrificial.** When a child gives up their last piece of candy to comfort a crying sibling, they're not being taught generosity—they're expressing what they know love requires. They expect this same sacrificial love from adults and are genuinely shocked when parents put their own convenience above their children's real needs.

**Love Creates Covenant.** Children are devastated by divorce precisely because they understand that "I love you" means forever. When they make friendship promises with their "best friend", they mean them as binding commitments. They can't comprehend why adults would treat love as temporary or conditional—it violates their deepest understanding of what love is.

**Love Requires Truth.** A child who discovers their parent has lied to them doesn't just feel disappointed—they feel betrayed at the core. They instinctively know that love and deception cannot coexist. When adults are authentic with them, children flourish; when adults are fake, children withdraw because they recognize love demands genuine transparency.

**Love Demands Justice.** Children become furious at bullying not because they're taught it's wrong, but because they know love means protecting the vulnerable. When they see injustice, their immediate response is "That's not fair!"—revealing their innate understanding that love requires standing up for what's right, even when it's costly.

**Love Shows Mercy.** When a child accidentally breaks something precious of Mom's, their immediate response isn't to hide or make excuses—they cry out for mercy with genuine anguish. They instinctively know they need forgiveness to restore the relationship, and their desperate plea reveals they understand that love must include mercy, or the bond they treasure will be broken.

**Love Creates Life-giving Communion.** Children naturally want to share everything with those they love—their discoveries, their fears, their joy. They include others instinctively and are wounded by exclusion because they know love builds community where everyone belongs and flourishes together.

These aren't learned behaviors—they're evidence that children instinctively understand what this book will demonstrate: that perfect love is indeed the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and true mercy into life-giving communion. Their profound disappointment when love fails to meet these standards reveals that this understanding is written on the human heart as natural law.

## Why We Need Liberation to Love

But here's the problem we all face. As we saw in Chapter 1, something has gone wrong with our ability to love. We know what love should look like, but we struggle to live it. We want to be loving people, but we find ourselves being selfish, petty, or hurtful instead. We long for deep, authentic relationships, but we keep settling for shallow connections or getting trapped in toxic patterns.

Jesus put His finger on the real issue when He said, "Everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin" (John 8:34). Here's the complete conversation that reveals what's really happening:

> Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him, "If you remain in my word, you will truly be my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free." They answered him, "We are descendants of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone. How can you say, 'You will become free'?" Jesus answered them, "Amen, amen, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin. A slave does not remain in a household forever, but a son remains forever. So if a son frees you, then you will truly be free." (John 8:31-36)

The Jews were looking for a political savior to free them from Roman occupation, but Jesus was talking about a deeper kind of slavery—the kind that happens inside us when we can't love the way we want to.

Think about it in your own life:

- **We know what love looks like** but find ourselves choosing what's easier or more immediately gratifying
- **We want to be patient and kind** but lose our temper with the people closest to us
- **We long for faithful, committed relationships** but get caught up in patterns that damage trust
- **We want to put others first** but end up being selfish when it really counts

This isn't just a matter of trying harder or having better willpower. There's something broken in our ability to love consistently and authentically. We're not free to love the way we want to—we're trapped by patterns of selfishness, fear, pride, and hurt that keep us from the very thing our hearts most desire.

This is exactly why Jesus came—not just to teach us about love, but to break the chains that keep us from living it. The Church's teachings about love aren't meant to burden us with more rules. They're meant to show us the path to freedom. When the Church says certain things about marriage, family, sexuality, or relationships, it's not trying to control us—it's trying to liberate us from the patterns that keep us stuck.

Without this kind of guidance and grace, our cry for love becomes like being hungry but not knowing which foods will nourish us and which will make us sick. We end up accepting counterfeits that promise satisfaction but leave us emptier than before.

The entire Catholic Faith, all her doctrines, every Mass, all her prayers are orienting us toward the deep Love of God that Christ revealed to us on the Cross.  Where Jesus was the perfect expression of how to love: a humble, obedient, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and true mercy into life-giving communion.

## The Foundation for the Entire Book

In these first two chapters, we have laid a crucial foundation: the fundamental problem facing humanity is the evil in man's heart, and Love—as uniquely and fully taught through the Catholic Faith—is the answer to that problem. We've seen that this isn't just theological theory but corresponds to the deepest cry of every human heart and the natural understanding that even children possess.

Our comprehensive definition—perfect love as "the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and true mercy into life-giving communion"—now serves as our roadmap for the entire journey ahead. Every subsequent chapter will unpack one aspect of this definition, showing in detail how each facet of authentic love directly combats specific forms of evil in our hearts and in the world.

At every step, we will see how perfect love—integrating all these elements—is not just a beautiful ideal but the practical, powerful answer to evil that the world desperately needs. Through the Catholic Faith, we have access to the fullness of this love, and through living it authentically, we become agents of the world's salvation.

Perfect love stands against all forms of evil and counterfeit love. It opposes mere sentiment by including objective standards of justice, harsh legalism by offering merciful forgiveness, individualism by emphasizing covenant relationships and communion, utilitarianism by recognizing the sacred dignity of each person made in God's image, relativism by grounding love in the objective reality of human dignity, and temporality by establishing permanent covenant bonds. We will explore these counterfeits and how authentic love defeats them in much greater detail in Chapter 6.

## Living the Response

Understanding what love truly is changes everything. It means we can resist counterfeits—either in our own hearts or in the culture around us. It means we have a standard by which to measure every relationship, every choice, every commitment. Most importantly, it means we can be liberated from the slavery of sin that corrupts our ability to love.

The saints understood this liberation. St. Thérèse of Lisieux called love "the vocation which includes all others." St. John the Apostle, the beloved disciple, spent his final years proclaiming the simple truth: "God is love." St. Augustine built his entire theology on the foundation that love is the ordering principle of all virtue—seeing justice, temperance, courage, and prudence as different facets of love itself. But they also understood that sin enslaves us and prevents us from loving—which is why they embraced the Church's teachings not as burdens, but as the very tools of their liberation.

These saints didn't just understand love intellectually—they lived it. They allowed God's perfect love to transform their hearts and liberate them from sin's slavery, and through them, it transformed the world. This is our calling also: to understand love so deeply that it transforms us from the inside out, freeing us to become instruments of God's love in a world desperately hungry for both truth and liberation.

As we conclude this chapter, let us take a moment to reflect on the profound implications of this comprehensive definition of love. May we allow its truth to sink deeply into our hearts, and may we be inspired to live this love authentically in our own lives.

> **"Perfect love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and true mercy into life-giving communion."**

*Heavenly Father, You are Love itself, and You have written the cry for love in every human heart. We confess that sin has enslaved us and corrupted our ability to love authentically. Liberate us through the truth of Your Son, Jesus Christ, who came to set the captives free. Help us to understand what love truly means—not the counterfeits the world offers, but the perfect love that flows from Your own divine nature. Break the chains of sin that prevent us from loving as we should, and give us the grace to live this love authentically, so that through us, others may encounter both the truth that liberates and the love they're truly seeking. Through Christ our Lord, who is Love incarnate and our Liberator. Amen.*

## Examen: Recognizing the Cry for Love

**Reflection Questions:**
1. How do I see the cry for love manifesting in my own life—in my body, mind, and soul?
2. What counterfeits of love have I been tempted to accept or offer to others?
3. How does understanding love as "sacred, sacrificial, covenantal, just, merciful, and life-giving" challenge my current relationships?
4. Where do I see the pure understanding of love that children possess, and how can I return to that clarity?
5. How has sin enslaved my ability to love, and where do I need Christ's liberation most?

**Daily Practice:** Each day this week, when you encounter someone (family member, coworker, stranger), try to recognize the cry for love in their words and actions. Ask yourself: "What is this person's heart truly longing for?" Then consider: "How can I respond with authentic love rather than a counterfeit?" Remember that your own liberation from sin's slavery enables you to help liberate others.

**Act of Contrition:** *My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart. In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good, I have sinned against You whom I should love above all things. I firmly intend, with Your grace, to do penance, to sin no more, and to avoid whatever leads me to sin. Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us. In His name, my God, have mercy. Amen.*

Understanding the universal cry for love is the first step toward becoming the kind of person who can satisfy that hunger in others. In the next chapter, we'll explore another universal cry that echoes through every human heart: the cry for justice. Together, these fundamental longings reveal the complete picture of what authentic love must include.
