*What Is Love? • Patrick Steil*

### Back Cover Blurb (new)
"Society is unraveling. Politicians lie without shame. Media manufactures truth. Schools teach children they can choose their gender while adults can't define what a woman is. Courts abandon law for political agendas. 'Justice' has become revenge. 'Mercy' enables destruction.

What is happening to our world?

This book reveals the shocking answer: We're witnessing justice and mercy severed from their source. As Christianity's influence fades, these virtues—meant to heal—have become weapons of division. We cry for justice but deliver mob rule. We preach mercy but enable evil. We demand love but can't define it.

The solution isn't another ideology. It's a return to the Author of truth, justice, and mercy—to discover what love actually IS. Not sentiment. Not tolerance. Not faith alone. But God's Perfect Love: the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant that binds truth, justice, and mercy into life-giving communion.

This isn't a theology textbook. It's a battle cry for all Catholics to start living the radical love that can save our bleeding world.

God's Perfect Love isn't just the answer. It's the only force powerful enough to heal what we've broken."

## Catholic Imagery (Final)

**Primary focal point**
- Crucifix with the Sacred Heart of Jesus — Christ on the Cross at center; His Heart visible and radiant (pierced/aflame), from which light and streams emanate (Truth + Mercy together).

**Covenant & Church**
- Three interwoven strands (rope-like) forming a church-shaped arch around the Crucifix (Trinity, covenant bond, Church as shelter of love).

**Justice (foundation)**
- Altar of stones beneath the Cross — rough-hewn stones forming a stable altar, the foundation of justice, upon which mercy flows and truth shines.

**Atmosphere**
- Radiance and flowing lines emanating from Christ’s Heart, downward and outward, covering the altar (mercy fulfilling justice, truth illuminating covenant).

**Hierarchy (to keep it minimalist)**
- Bold: Crucifix + Sacred Heart
- Subtle: Covenant arch, stone altar
- Atmospheric: Radiance/streams

- Altar simplified (single stone course).
- Title large; subtitle tighter; more negative space for reverence.
