# Chapter 1: The Problem of Evil

*"We know that all creation is groaning in labor pains even until now."*
— Romans 8:22

*"If God the Father almighty, the Creator of the ordered and good world, cares for all his creatures, why does evil exist? To this question, as pressing as it is unavoidable and as painful as it is mysterious, no quick answer will suffice. Only Christian faith as a whole constitutes the answer to this question: the goodness of creation, the drama of sin and the patient love of God who comes to meet man by his covenants, the redemptive Incarnation of his Son, his gift of the Spirit, his gathering of the Church, the power of the sacraments and his call to a blessed life to which free creatures are invited to consent in advance, but from which, by a terrible mystery, they can also turn away in advance. There is not a single aspect of the Christian message that is not in part an answer to the question of evil."*
— Catechism of the Catholic Church 309

## The Urgency of Our Response

We live in a time of intensifying moral confusion. Children are told they can choose their gender. Marriage is redefined to exclude children. The innocent are killed in the womb. Divorce has become normalized and children are pitted against the parents. Euthanasia is becoming acceptable. Following the law is becoming optional.

Truth itself has been declared unknowable.

The rampant evil serves as a stark contrast that illuminates the truth—showing clearly where life without God leads. When society abandons divine laws of love, the results are undeniable: broken families, confused children, despair, and death. We lose the very fabric of human dignity and the foundation that justice and mercy provide for authentic human flourishing.

This contrast helps even skeptics see that human solutions devoid of God don't just fail—they actively destroy what they claim to protect. The evil has real effects, but the rest of this book will show that God's love is always more powerful than evil.

Yet the moral confusion of our time is not unique. What we're witnessing today is simply the latest chapter in a much older story.

## The Cry That Echoes Through History

There's a sound that echoes through every generation, in every culture, across every continent. It's the sound of creation itself groaning under the weight of something that shouldn't be there. This sound is the problem of evil—not just natural disasters or physical suffering, but the moral evil that flows from human choices to reject good and choose what is harmful, selfish, and destructive.

## The Reality Children See Clearly

Watch a five-year-old witness an act of cruelty, and you'll see something remarkable: immediate, instinctive moral clarity. They don't need a philosophy course to know that hurting someone innocent is wrong. This childlike moral clarity reflects the **natural law written on every human heart** (Romans 2:15). As the Second Vatican Council teaches, "Deep within his conscience man discovers a law which he has not laid upon himself but which he must obey. Its voice, ever calling him to love and to do what is good and to avoid evil, sounds in his heart at the right moment" (*Gaudium et Spes* 16).

## The Nature and Scope of Moral Evil

Moral evil results from free choices to reject good. St. Augustine's profound insight teaches us that "Evil is not a substance or a nature; it is rather a privation or absence of good. Evil has no positive existence of its own; it exists only as a corruption or distortion of good" (*Confessions*). This understanding helps us categorize the four manifestations of moral evil:

**Personal Evil:** Individual choices to disobey God—pride, lust, greed, envy, gluttony, anger, sloth.

**Relational Evil:** The breakdown of covenant bonds—adultery, divorce, abandonment, betrayal, exploitation.

**Social Evil:** Systemic injustices—slavery, trafficking, economic exploitation, political corruption, cultural lies that deny human dignity.

**Spiritual Evil:** The rejection of God Himself—atheism, relativism, despair, idolatry.

## Sin: The Root of All Evil

This brings us to the heart of the Catholic teaching on sin—and to the heart of why evil exists in our world. Sin is not merely "making mistakes" or "being imperfect"—it is the deliberate choice to reject love and embrace what is opposed to love. The Catechism of the Catholic Church defines sin as "an offense against reason, truth, and right conscience; it is failure in genuine love for God and neighbor caused by a perverse attachment to certain goods" (CCC 1849).

**The Pattern of Sin vs. Love**

As I contemplated St. Augustine's description that love is willing the good of another and thinking deeply over sin and love, I discovered these ways of describing what happens we when we choose sin over love.

> Love is an action we take which chooses the good of others at our expense.

> Sin (or evil) is an action that we take which chooses a perceived good for ourselves at the expense of others.

And note the use of "the good" vs "a perceived good". True love always chooses (at least our best understanding) of what is "truly good" for the other.  Sin often chooses what we perceive to be good for ourselves, but usually it is a distorted or false understanding of what is good for us.  It violates the definition of love in some way - usually it is not based on truth, or is not just in some way, or it is not merciful or sacrificial in some way, etc.

This is why sin inevitably produces evil—it creates harm by prioritizing self over others—while love produces healing by choosing sacrifice for others' benefit.

Every evil we see in our world—every act of violence, every betrayal, every injustice, every cruelty—can be traced back to this fundamental reality: human hearts choosing sin over love. This is why the problem of evil is ultimately a problem of the human heart.

Consider these concrete examples:

- **Abortion** takes innocent life when people choose convenience over love for the vulnerable
- **Child abuse** happens when someone chooses their own disordered desires over love for the innocent
- **Adultery** destroys families when spouses choose selfish pleasure over covenant love
- **Pornography** destroys the bonds of marriage (current or future) when spouses choose fantasy and self-pleasure over unity with their actual spouse (or even future spouse)
- **Divorce** breaks covenant bonds when spouses choose personal happiness over sacrificial love
- **Gender ideology** confuses children when adults choose political correctness over love for truth and child welfare

In every case, evil flows from a human heart that made a choice: either love God and neighbor, seeking their authentic good, or choose self, sin, and what appears immediately gratifying.

## Sin: The Root of All Evil

> *"Sin is not just a psychological weakness... It is something much more serious: it is a mystery of iniquity that affects the very heart of human existence."*
> — Pope John Paul II, *Reconciliatio et Paenitentia* 15

**What is Sin?** The Catechism teaches us that "sin is an offense against reason, truth, and right conscience; it is failure in genuine love for God and neighbor caused by a perverse attachment to certain goods" (CCC 1849). Every sin, whether it seems "small" or "great," is fundamentally a *choice* to reject authentic love—love of God, love of neighbor, or proper love of self.

**What is Evil?** Evil, by contrast, is not a choice but the *consequence* of sinful choices. As St. Augustine taught, evil is not a substance but a privation of good—it exists only as a corruption or absence of the good that should be there. Evil has no power on its own; it is always the result of someone choosing to reject love.

**How Sin Creates Evil:** When we sin, we choose our own will over God's will, our own desires over the good of others, our own immediate gratification over what is truly good for us. These sinful choices then produce evil consequences:

- **Personal evil** comes from individual sins that further wound our own souls
- **Relational evil** comes from sins against covenant bonds that break families and friendships
- **Social evil** comes from collective sins that become embedded in systems and cultures
- **Spiritual evil** comes from the fundamental sin of rejecting God Himself

> *"Original sin is the 'reverse side' of the Good News that Jesus is the Savior of all men, that all need salvation and that salvation is offered to all through Christ."*
> — Catechism of the Catholic Church 389

**Why Sin Always Produces Evil:** Because we are created in the image of God and made for love, sin is always a choice against our own deepest nature. It promises happiness but delivers misery, promises freedom but delivers slavery, promises life but delivers death. The consequences of our sinful choices are devastatingly real: waves of pain, broken relationships, and cycles of suffering that ripple outward from every choice to reject love.

**The Gravity of Our Choices:** Understanding this relationship between sin and evil helps us see why the Church takes sin so seriously. It's not because God is a harsh judge looking to condemn us, but because sin literally destroys what we are made for—love, communion, happiness, peace. Every sin, no matter how "small" it may seem, contributes to the ocean of evil that drowns our world in suffering.

> *"Sin is before all else an offense against God, a rupture of communion with him. At the same time it damages communion with the Church."*
> — Catechism of the Catholic Church 1440

Every sin is a public sin, a sin against the entire Body of Christ.

**What We Really Need:** This comprehensive understanding reveals the depth of our human predicament. We cannot simply "try harder" to be good people. Sin has wounded our nature so deeply that we need:

- A **perfect lawgiver** who can show us what authentic love truly looks like
- A **perfect teacher** who can instruct us in the way of love without error or self-interest
- Someone who can show us the **extent and fullness of God's perfect truth, justice, and mercy**
- Someone who **understands us completely**—our struggles, our weaknesses, our deepest longings
- Someone we can **relate to**—who has experienced what we experience, yet without sin
- **Divine grace** to heal our wounded nature and transform our hearts
- **Perfect love** to overcome the evil that flows from our sinful choices

If only God had sent us someone who could be all of these things!

**The Answer: Jesus, the Christ:** But this is exactly what God did! In the Incarnation, God the Son became man—fully divine and fully human. Jesus Christ is the perfect lawgiver ("I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life"), the perfect teacher ("Learn from me, for I am gentle and humble of heart"), the one who reveals the fullness of God's truth, justice, and mercy ("Whoever has seen me has seen the Father"), the one who understands us completely ("He was tempted in every way that we are, yet never sinned"), and the one we can relate to ("The Word became flesh and dwelt among us"). Only perfect love—God's own love incarnate—can overcome the evil that flows from sin by transforming the hearts where sinful choices are made.

We will dive deeper into the love of Jesus Christ in Chapter 9.

## How Love Combats Every Form of Evil

This book will show how each facet of authentic love—as revealed in Jesus Christ—directly confronts specific forms of evil. Perfect love is "the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant, binding truth, justice, and mercy, gathering us into life-giving communion," and each aspect of this definition becomes a weapon against evil:

**Truth** conquers the evil of deception and lies that keep souls in darkness and prevent authentic relationships.

**Justice** conquers the evil of oppression and exploitation that treats human beings as objects rather than subjects worthy of what they are due based on their dignity as human beings created in the image of God.

**Mercy** conquers the evil of hardness of heart and cycles of revenge that perpetuate suffering and prevent healing.

**Sacrifice** conquers the evil of selfishness and pride—the root sins that make us choose ourselves over God and neighbor.

**Sacred Covenant** conquers the evil of broken promises and disposable relationships that leave children and the vulnerable without protection.

**Life-giving Communion** conquers the evil of isolation, loneliness, and division that fragments human community.

Notice that these are not separate, competing solutions—they are all facets of the one perfect love revealed in Jesus Christ. Each virtue serves and strengthens the others, creating an integrated response to evil that addresses both its symptoms and its source: the human heart that chooses lesser goods over the Supreme Good.

This is why no partial solution can work. Evil is a comprehensive problem requiring a comprehensive response. Only perfect love—integrating all these facets—can heal what selfish sin has broken.

## Why Human Solutions Fall Short

Throughout history, humanity has attempted various solutions to evil, each failing because it cannot address the fundamental problem of the human heart:

**Political Solutions** promise to legislate evil away, but they violate perfect love by:
- **Rejecting the Sacred:** Attempting to solve spiritual problems through purely human power, ignoring God's sovereignty
- **Avoiding Sacrifice:** Seeking power and control rather than self-giving service
- **Breaking Covenant:** Politicians break promises when convenient, showing love is conditional on political gain
- **Distorting Justice:** Using law to serve political interests rather than objective truth and human dignity
- **Lacking Mercy:** Often becoming vindictive toward political opponents rather than seeking genuine reconciliation
- **Fragmenting Communion:** Dividing people into political tribes rather than building authentic community

**Educational Solutions** assume knowledge conquers evil, yet they violate perfect love by:
- **Denying the Sacred:** Treating humans as mere material beings who can be "fixed" through information alone
- **Refusing Sacrifice:** Believing we can achieve goodness without the cost of moral transformation
- **Ignoring Covenant:** Focusing on individual achievement rather than relationships of fidelity and commitment
- **Separating Truth from Love:** Teaching facts without wisdom, knowledge without virtue
- **Bypassing Justice and Mercy:** Assuming education eliminates the need for moral accountability and forgiveness
- **Creating Intellectual Pride:** Fostering arrogance that destroys rather than builds authentic communion

**Economic Solutions** claim eliminating poverty eliminates evil, yet they violate perfect love by:
- **Reducing the Sacred:** Treating humans as economic units rather than beings made in God's image
- **Avoiding Sacrifice:** Promising prosperity without the spiritual cost of virtue and self-discipline
- **Undermining Covenant:** Prioritizing material transactions over permanent relationships of love
- **Distorting Justice:** Defining fairness purely in material terms rather than what each person truly deserves as an image-bearer of God
- **Replacing Mercy:** Substituting government programs for personal acts of compassion and forgiveness
- **Destroying Communion:** Creating class warfare and envy rather than genuine community based on shared dignity

**Technological Solutions** promise to engineer utopia, yet they violate perfect love by:
- **Desacralizing Life:** Treating humans as machines to be optimized rather than souls to be loved
- **Eliminating Sacrifice:** Seeking comfort and convenience rather than the growth that comes through suffering and self-giving
- **Breaking Covenant:** Replacing permanent human relationships with temporary digital connections
- **Obscuring Truth:** Creating virtual realities that distract from moral reality and authentic human nature
- **Bypassing Justice and Mercy:** Using technology to avoid the hard work of moral accountability and forgiveness
- **Isolating Rather Than Gathering:** Fragmenting human community through digital addiction and artificial relationships

**Secular Solutions** attempt to eliminate God, yet they violate perfect love most fundamentally by:
- **Denying the Sacred Entirely:** Rejecting the very source and foundation of authentic love
- **Making Self the Ultimate Sacrifice:** Worshiping human reason and will rather than submitting to divine love
- **Rejecting Divine Covenant:** Breaking the fundamental relationship that makes all other authentic relationships possible
- **Relativizing Truth:** Making human opinion rather than divine revelation the measure of reality
- **Corrupting Justice and Mercy:** Without God as the standard, justice becomes arbitrary power and mercy becomes mere sentiment
- **Destroying True Communion:** As Vatican II warns, "Without the Creator the creature vanishes... When God is forgotten the creature itself grows unintelligible" (*Gaudium et Spes* 36)

Each of these approaches fails because it violates one or more essential aspects of perfect love. They cannot address the fundamental problem: the human heart that chooses evil over good, because they do not understand what good actually is—the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant, binding truth, justice, and mercy, gathering us into life-giving communion.

If we are to address the root cause of evil, we must attack it at its source: the human heart. We must show people that true love, one grounded in God and His laws of love, is the only way to a full, abundant, true, just, merciful and meaningful life that satisfies our deepest longings.

But in order to do that we need to understand the true nature of love, so keep reading. We will dive into the nature of God's Perfect Love in the next chapter.


## A Personal Examination

Before we proceed to explore the facets of love, we must honestly confront the evil in our own hearts. We cannot fight the evil "out there" until we acknowledge the evil "in here."

**Body:** How has evil affected your physical being? What habits, addictions, or behaviors harm your body or the bodies of others?

**Mind:** How has evil clouded your thinking? What lies do you believe? What truths do you resist?

**Soul:** How has evil damaged your relationship with God? What sins separate you from His love? What wounds need His healing?

This isn't meant to discourage you, but to help you recognize your need for the perfect love that can heal all these wounds. The Saints weren't people who never struggled with evil—they were people who learned to let God's love transform their struggles into victories.

As we see in the story of Cain and Abel (Genesis 4:1-16), evil entered the world through human choice very early in history. Cain's jealousy and anger led to the first murder, showing us that evil flows from disordered desires in the human heart. St. James reminds us: "Where do the wars and where do the conflicts among you come from? Is it not from your passions that make war within your members?" (James 4:1).

The Catechism teaches us that each human being has the ability to choose between good and evil.

> "God created man a rational being, conferring on him the dignity of a person who can initiate and control his own actions. "God willed that man should be 'left in the hand of his own counsel,' so that he might of his own accord seek his Creator and freely attain his full and blessed perfection by cleaving to him."

This gift of free will makes us capable of great good, but also capable of choosing evil. As the Catechism further explains:

> "Sin is an offense against reason, truth, and right conscience; it is failure in genuine love for God and neighbor caused by a perverse attachment to certain goods" (CCC 1849).

**This is the crucial insight**: Evil is not some external force that attacks us from outside. Evil originates in the human heart when we choose our own will over God's will, our own desires over the good of others, our own immediate gratification over what is truly good. Every act of moral evil—from the "smallest" lie to the greatest atrocity—begins with a choice made in a human heart to reject God's love and embrace selfishness.

This means that if we want to fight evil effectively, we cannot simply address external symptoms. We must address the source: the human heart that chooses evil over good, self over others, pride over humility, hatred over love.

> "Evil has no positive nature; but the loss of good has received the name 'evil.'" — St. Augustine, City of God, Book XI, Chapter 9

To fight against evil, we must repent (turn our hearts back to God) and allow Him to fill our hearts with His Perfect Love, which then enables us to respond with faith, hope, and charity. This will be our topic for Chapter 2 and the rest of this book.

## The Dual Purpose of This Journey

This book serves two essential purposes that work together:

**First, Personal Transformation:** You will learn to recognize the evil in your own heart—not to condemn yourself, but to turn toward God's perfect love. Every sin is ultimately a choice of a lesser good over the highest good. When we choose pleasure over purity, convenience over life, lies over truth, or self over God, we're not choosing something wholly evil—we're choosing something less than what we're made for. This recognition leads to true repentance: turning away from lesser goods and toward the Supreme Good who is God Himself. In fact we have shown that evil has no power other than what we give it by choosing to reject God's perfect love.

**Second, Charitable and Natural Evangelization:** As you experience this transformation, you'll learn how to share these truths with others—both victims and perpetrators of evil. This book equips you to:

- **Show the emptiness of lesser goods:** Help others see how their pursuits—whether money, pleasure, power, or even distorted forms of love—can never satisfy the infinite longing of the human heart
- **Present the fullness of the Church's teaching:** Not as a list of rules, but as a comprehensive vision of human flourishing rooted in divine love
- **Guide others to repentance:** Not through condemnation, but by revealing the beauty of what they're missing when they settle for lesser goods
- **Model authentic dialogue:** Demonstrate how to discuss difficult moral issues with both truth and compassion

When someone is trapped in sin—whether as victim or perpetrator—they need more than judgment or sympathy. They need someone who can show them that their deepest desires are good but misdirected. The adulterer seeks love but in the wrong place. The thief seeks security but through the wrong means. The liar seeks acceptance but through deception. The gender confused teen seeks identity and acceptance but at the sake of truth and their own dignity. Each is pursuing a real good but in a disordered way that ultimately can never satisfy what they seek.

Your own journey of recognizing and turning from evil in your heart becomes the foundation for helping others do the same. As you learn to articulate why you've chosen God's love over lesser goods, you become equipped to invite others into that same transformative choice.

This is the Church's method: first, personal holiness; then, evangelization through witness and word. You cannot give what you do not have. But as you receive God's perfect love and let it transform you, you become a living witness to its power—and a guide for others seeking the same transformation.

## Living the Response

As we continue this journey together, remember that every chapter, every virtue, every practice we explore is part of the complete response to evil. You're not just learning about love—you're being equipped to live out your faith and make God's love tangible in a world that desperately needs it.

The transformation begins where evil begins: in the human heart. The saints understood this truth. They first let God's perfect love transform the evil within themselves. They discovered that perfect love really is the answer—not just in theory, but in practice.

Now it's our turn. The world groans, but love stands ready to respond. And that love wants to work through you—starting with your own heart, then flowing out to transform the world.

*Lord Jesus, You are perfect love incarnate. You faced the full reality of evil on the cross and conquered it through Your death and resurrection. Help us to see clearly the evil in our world and in our own hearts, not to despair, but to turn to You with confidence. Transform us into agents of Your perfect love. Give us the courage to confront evil wherever we find it, and the wisdom to respond with the integration of justice and mercy that You have shown us. We ask this through Your most holy name. Amen.*

**Examen:**

Begin each day this week with an honest examination of conscience, asking the Holy Spirit to reveal areas where evil has taken root in your heart. As you do this, also notice one specific example of moral evil in the world around you (in news, relationships, society). Connect these two observations: How does the evil you see "out there" relate to similar tendencies in your own heart?

Reflect on these questions:
- What forms of evil in our world most deeply disturb you? How might perfect love address these specific evils?
- How has evil affected your own body, mind, and soul? What healing do you need from God's perfect love?
- Which human solutions to evil have you been most tempted to rely on instead of turning to God's love?
- How can you begin to see yourself as an agent of God's perfect love in response to the evil around you?

Instead of becoming discouraged by what you discover, offer a prayer for those affected by the evils you've identified—including yourself. Ask God to show you how His perfect love might work through your transformed heart to address both your personal struggles and the larger evils you've recognized.

Remember: the same type of evil that manifests as major social problems often begins as subtle temptations in our own hearts. Your personal transformation through God's love becomes part of His answer to the world's suffering.

Close each examination by praying the Act of Contrition:

*O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee, and I detest all my sins because I dread the loss of Heaven and the pains of Hell; but most of all because they offend Thee, my God, Who art all-good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace, to confess my sins, to do penance, and to amend my life. Amen.*

At the close of each chapter, we will provide resources for those who want to dive deeper into what our Catholic faith teaches about the topic we've explored. These references—from Scripture, the Catechism, and the lives of the saints—offer you the opportunity to study more thoroughly the Church's wisdom on these matters. Whether you're seeking to strengthen your own understanding or preparing to share these truths with others, these resources will guide you to the authoritative sources of our faith.
