## The Universal Cry That Reveals Our Nature

"That's not fair!"

These three words, spoken countless times by children on playgrounds and adults in boardrooms, reveal something profound about human nature. Whether it's a child protesting an unequal distribution of candy or an adult witnessing corruption in government, this instinctive cry emerges from the deepest part of our being. It's not learned behavior—it's written on our hearts.

This universal cry for justice reveals that we are created for moral order, not chaos. Every human being, regardless of culture, education, or background, possesses an innate sense that things *ought* to be fair, that people *ought* to be treated with dignity, and that wrongs *ought* to be made right. Scripture suggests this isn't mere social conditioning—it's evidence of our creation in the image of God, who is perfectly just. As St. Paul explains, even those without the written law "show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness" (Romans 2:15).

## What Children Know About Justice

Before adults complicate justice with sophisticated legal theories and cultural relativism, children demonstrate pure moral clarity about fairness:

**"Everyone should be treated the same!"** Children instinctively expect equal treatment in similar circumstances. They know that favoritism based on arbitrary preferences violates something fundamental about human dignity.

**"Bullies should be stopped!"** Children understand that using power to harm the weak is evil. They expect authority figures to protect the vulnerable and hold wrongdoers accountable.

**"Promises should be kept!"** Children know that breaking your word damages trust and violates justice. They understand that reliability and truthfulness are essential for relationships.

**"Stealing is wrong!"** Without being taught complex theories of property rights, children know that taking what belongs to others violates justice. They understand the connection between work, ownership, and respect for others.

**"Truth should win!"** Children expect honesty to be rewarded and lies to be exposed. They have an innate sense that reality matters and that deception corrupts the moral order.

This childlike understanding reflects what St. Paul describes as "the law written on their hearts" (Romans 2:15). Children see justice clearly because they haven’t yet learned to rationalize evil or compromise with injustice. Jesus' command to "become like children" (Matthew 18:3) includes recovering this moral clarity that recognizes injustice immediately.

## The Nature of True Justice

Justice is not merely human opinion or social convention—it flows from God's own nature and is written on every human heart through natural law. The Catechism teaches us that "the natural law expresses the original moral sense which enables man to discern by reason the good and the evil" (CCC 1954).

### Divine Foundation of Justice

**God is perfectly just.** Justice flows from God's nature as the source of all moral order. As the Psalmist declares, "The Lord is righteous in all his ways and kind in all his works" (Psalm 145:17). God's justice is not arbitrary but reflects His perfect knowledge of truth and His infinite love for creation.

**Natural law written on hearts.** God has inscribed basic principles of justice on every human heart, which is why even those who don't know Scripture instinctively recognize certain actions as right or wrong. This universal moral sense proves that justice transcends cultural preferences.

**Objective moral order.** Right and wrong exist independently of human opinion. Justice is not determined by majority vote or cultural consensus but by the truth about human nature and our relationship to God.

### Justice as Giving Each Their Due

True justice is fundamentally about **giving each being what they are owed** according to their nature, dignity, and relationship to us. This positive understanding goes far beyond merely avoiding harm—it actively seeks to honor the dignity and rights of every person.

**Justice Toward God:**
- **Worship and adoration** - God deserves our complete reverence as Creator and Lord
- **Obedience** - Following God's commandments as acknowledgment of His authority
- **Gratitude** - Recognizing all good things come from Him and giving thanks
- **Trust** - Believing in His goodness and providence even in difficulties

**Justice Toward Our Neighbor:**
- **Respect for dignity** - Treating every person as created in God's image
- **Honesty** - Speaking truth and keeping promises in all our dealings
- **Fairness** - Giving equal treatment regardless of personal preference
- **Protection** - Defending the innocent and vulnerable from harm

**Justice Toward Ourselves:**
- **Self-respect** - Honoring our own dignity as children of God
- **Self-discipline** - Ordering our desires according to reason and faith
- **Self-development** - Cultivating our talents for God's glory

## Jesus: The Perfect Integration of Justice and Mercy

Before we explore the nature of justice further, we must look to Jesus Christ, who perfectly demonstrates how justice and mercy work together in authentic love. Throughout the Gospels, we see Jesus embodying this perfect balance, never compromising either virtue.

### The Woman Caught in Adultery (John 8:1-11)

When the scribes and Pharisees brought the woman caught in adultery to Jesus, they sought to trap Him between justice and mercy. The Law demanded stoning (justice), but they expected Jesus to show mercy that would contradict the Law. Instead, Jesus demonstrated perfect integration:

**He acknowledged the demands of justice:** "Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her" (John 8:7). Jesus didn't dismiss the Law or claim adultery wasn't sinful.

**He offered transformative mercy:** "Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more" (John 8:11). His mercy wasn't permissiveness—it demanded repentance and transformation.

**He revealed deeper justice:** By exposing the accusers' own sinfulness, Jesus showed that true justice must begin with examining our own hearts.

### Zacchaeus: Justice Inspiring Generous Restitution (Luke 19:1-10)

When Jesus showed mercy to Zacchaeus the tax collector, notice what happened: Zacchaeus immediately responded with justice that went beyond legal requirements:

> "Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold." (Luke 19:8)

Jesus' mercy didn't excuse Zacchaeus's past injustices—it inspired him to make restitution that exceeded what the Law required (Exodus 22:1 required only double restitution for theft). True mercy awakens the desire for justice, not the excuse to avoid it.

### The Cleansing of the Temple (Matthew 21:12-13)

Jesus' cleansing of the temple shows that authentic love sometimes requires forceful justice:

> "And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. He said to them, 'It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you make it a den of robbers.'"

This wasn't anger contradicting love—it was love expressing itself through justice. Jesus' righteous anger protected the vulnerable (the poor being exploited) and defended the sacred (God's house being profaned). Sometimes love requires confronting injustice directly. But Jesus also showed mercy and restraint. He could have used his divine power to banish them, caused some physical harm, or even killed them. But He chose to show mercy and restraint.

### The Rich Young Man (Mark 10:17-22)

When the rich young man asked about eternal life, Jesus first pointed him to justice—keeping the commandments. But then He revealed that perfect love requires going beyond minimal justice:

> "You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me." (Mark 10:21)

Jesus showed that while justice establishes the foundation (keeping commandments), love calls us to generous sacrifice that serves others' needs. The young man's sadness reveals how difficult it is to move from mere justice to perfect love.

These Gospel examples show us that authentic justice and mercy don't compete—they complete each other in the perfect love that Jesus embodies.

## The Hierarchy of Justice: Biblical Foundation

Scripture reveals that different beings deserve different types and degrees of reverence, creating what we might call a proper ordering of our duties. This hierarchy isn't arbitrary but reflects the order established by God Himself:

### God First: The Great Commandment
> "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment." (Matthew 22:37-38)

Jesus establishes that our first duty of justice is to God—giving Him the supreme worship, adoration, and obedience He deserves as Creator and Lord.

### Parents and Authority: The Fourth Commandment
> "Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the Lord your God is giving you." (Exodus 20:12)

Scripture consistently places honor for parents and legitimate authority immediately after duties to God, showing their special place in the hierarchy of justice.

### Neighbor as Yourself: The Second Great Commandment
> "And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Matthew 22:39)

Jesus reveals that justice toward our neighbor must be measured by proper justice (and mercy) toward ourselves—neither neglecting our legitimate needs nor serving ourselves at others' expense.

### Civil and Religious Authority
> "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's." (Mark 12:17)
> "Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you." (Hebrews 13:17)

This shows that both civil and religious authority have a special place in the hierarchy of justice, with civil authority having the duty to protect the common good and religious authority having the duty to protect the faith.

### Creation Under Our Stewardship
> "And God said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.'" (Genesis 1:28)

Scripture shows that humans have a special responsibility for creation—not as owners but as stewards accountable to God.

This biblical ordering prevents the disorder that occurs when we give ultimate devotion to finite goods or treat unequal things as if they were equal. As Jesus warned, "No one can serve two masters" (Matthew 6:24).

## Justice Grounded in the Image of God

**The foundation of all authentic justice is the recognition that every human being is created in the image of God (Genesis 1:27). This truth transforms justice from mere social utility into sacred duty.**

### What Imago Dei Demands

**Right to Life:** From conception to natural death, because every human life bears God's image. This is why abortion, euthanasia, and murder are grave injustices—they destroy the image of God.

**Right to Family:** Children deserve both mother and father, reflecting the complementarity of God's image in male and female. This is why the redefinition of marriage harms children and violates justice.

**Right to Truth:** Humans are rational beings made in God's image and deserve to know the truth about reality, morality, and their ultimate destiny.

**Right to Freedom:** Authentic freedom to choose the good, not license to sin. True freedom serves justice by enabling us to fulfill our nature as God's image-bearers.

**Right to Property:** Stewardship of creation as God's representatives, including the fruits of our labor and the resources needed for human flourishing.

**Right to Worship:** Recognition of our relationship with our Creator and the freedom to live according to our conscience.

### How This Combats Evil

When we ground justice in the image of God, we combat specific forms of evil:

**Prevents Dehumanization:** Recognizing God's image in every person stops the evil of treating humans as less than human, whether through slavery, exploitation, or ideological oppression.

**Stops Utilitarian Abuse:** We cannot use people as mere means to our ends when they bear God's image. Every person has inherent dignity that must be respected.

**Defends the Vulnerable:** Special protection for those who cannot defend themselves—the unborn, elderly, disabled, and poor—because they too bear God's image fully.

**Establishes Objective Standards:** Justice is not relative but reflects God's unchanging character. This prevents the strong from defining "justice" according to their preferences.

## The Hierarchy of Justice

True justice recognizes that different beings deserve different types and degrees of reverence, creating a proper ordering of our duties:

1. **God First** - Supreme worship, adoration, and obedience
2. **Parents and Authority** - Honor, respect, and appropriate obedience
3. **Spouse and Family** - Faithful love, commitment, and service
4. **Neighbors and Community** - Respect, fairness, and charitable assistance
5. **Self** - Proper care and development according to our dignity
6. **Creation** - Responsible stewardship and grateful use

This hierarchy prevents the disorder that occurs when we give ultimate devotion to finite goods or treat unequal things as if they were equal.

## How Justice Serves Love

Justice is not opposed to love but is love's foundation. Without justice, love becomes mere sentiment; without love, justice becomes cold legalism. Perfect love requires both.

> "Justice without mercy is cruelty; mercy without justice is the mother of dissolution."
> — St. Thomas Aquinas

> "Love will always prove necessary, even in the most just society."
> — Pope Benedict XVI, *Deus Caritas Est*

**Creates Order:** Justice establishes the conditions in which love can flourish. When people know their rights will be respected and their dignity honored, they can trust enough to love.

**Protects the Vulnerable:** Justice defends those who cannot defend themselves, creating space for the weak to experience love without fear.

**Enables Trust:** Justice creates the reliability necessary for deep relationships. We can only love those we trust to treat us justly.

**Demands Truth:** Justice requires honesty about what is real and what is good. Love built on lies is not authentic love.

**Prepares for Mercy:** Justice establishes the moral order that makes mercy meaningful. Mercy is only beautiful when it transcends justice, not when it ignores it.

## The Cry for Justice in Our Time

The universal cry for justice is particularly urgent in our contemporary world, where fundamental human rights are under assault:

> "Justice is both the aim and the intrinsic criterion of all politics. Politics is more than a mere mechanism for defining the rules of public life: its origin and its goal are found in justice, which by its very nature has to do with ethics."
> — Pope Benedict XVI, *Deus Caritas Est*

**Attacks on Human Life:** The widespread acceptance of abortion and euthanasia represents a fundamental denial of the right to life of those who bear God's image. When societies decide that some human lives are "unwanted" or "burdensome," they violate the most basic principle of justice.

**Destruction of Marriage and Family:** The redefinition of marriage undermines children's fundamental right to both mother and father. Scripture reveals that God created them "male and female" (Genesis 1:27) and that children thrive when raised by their biological parents in stable, committed relationships.

**Economic Exploitation:** Unjust wages, human trafficking, and exploitation of workers treat human beings as mere economic units rather than image-bearers of God. The Old Testament consistently condemns those who "oppress the hired worker in his wages" (Malachi 3:5).

**Religious Persecution:** The denial of freedom of conscience and worship attacks the fundamental human relationship with God. Jesus Himself affirmed this principle: "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's" (Mark 12:17).

**Cultural Corruption:** The normalization of vice and suppression of virtue corrupts the moral environment necessary for human flourishing. As Isaiah warned: "Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness" (Isaiah 5:20).

**Educational Indoctrination:** Teaching children ideologies that contradict natural law and human dignity violates their right to truth. Parents have the primary responsibility for their children's education, as Scripture teaches: "Train the young in the way they should go; even when old, they will not swerve from it." (Proverbs 22:6).

Each of these injustices cries out for remedy because each violates the dignity of those created in God's image.

## Justice, Truth, and Mercy: Three Cords of Perfect Love

True justice cannot exist in isolation—it requires both truth and mercy to be authentic. These three virtues form an inseparable unity that reflects God's own nature and defines perfect love. Scripture reveals this profound interconnection throughout salvation history.

> "Steadfast love and faithfulness meet; righteousness and peace kiss each other. Faithfulness springs up from the ground, and righteousness looks down from heaven."
> — Psalm 85:10-11

### Biblical Foundation for Their Unity

**The Trinity of Divine Attributes:** Psalm 85:10-11 reveals a profound truth about God's nature: "Steadfast love and faithfulness meet; righteousness and peace kiss each other. Faithfulness springs up from the ground, and righteousness looks down from heaven." This poetic language shows us that God's steadfast love (mercy), faithfulness (truth), and righteousness (justice) are not competing attributes but complementary perfections that "meet" and "kiss each other." In God, these virtues are perfectly unified.

**Jesus as the Perfect Integration:** Christ embodies this perfect unity throughout His earthly ministry. John 1:14 tells us He is "full of grace and truth"—mercy and truth united in one Person. We see this integration in every encounter: His justice is always truthful, His mercy is always just, and His truth is always merciful.

**The Great Commandment's Structure:** When Jesus summarizes the Law in Matthew 22:37-39, He reveals the proper order that integrates all three virtues: love God (justice toward our Creator) with all truth (heart, soul, mind) and love neighbor as yourself (mercy that goes beyond mere justice). Truth, justice, and mercy are woven together in perfect love.

**Old Testament Witnesses:** The prophets consistently called for this integration. Isaiah 1:17 commands: "Learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression" and Micah 6:8 makes this even clearer: "What does the Lord require of you but to do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God?" All three are required, not optional.

### Justice Requires Truth

**No justice without truth.** Justice that is not based on reality becomes mere opinion or preference. We cannot give each person their due if we don't know the truth about human nature, moral law, and God's design for creation. As Jesus declared, "You shall know the truth, and the truth will set you free" (John 8:32).

**Truth about human dignity.** Justice depends fundamentally on the truth that every person is created in God's image and possesses inherent dignity. When societies deny this truth—as in slavery, abortion, or euthanasia—justice becomes arbitrary power exercised by the strong over the weak.

**Truth about moral law.** Justice requires knowing what is actually right and wrong, not just what feels good or seems popular. Scripture teaches that this moral law is written on our hearts: "When Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts" (Romans 2:14-15).

**Truth about consequences.** Justice demands honesty about the real effects of actions—both good and evil. We cannot address injustice if we refuse to acknowledge its true causes and effects. The prophets consistently called Israel to face the truth about their sins and their consequences.

### Justice Requires Mercy

**Justice alone becomes harsh.** Pure justice without mercy would demand perfect punishment for every trivial fault. While God's justice is perfect, His mercy makes forgiveness and redemption possible. As Jesus taught in the Beatitudes: "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy" (Matthew 5:7).

**Mercy transcends but doesn't ignore justice.** True mercy acknowledges what justice demands and then offers something greater. We see this perfectly in Jesus' response to the thief on the cross (Luke 23:39-43). The thief acknowledged his just punishment ("we are receiving the due reward of our deeds"), but Jesus offered mercy that transcended justice ("today you will be with me in paradise"). Mercy that ignores justice, however, is not mercy but permissiveness that enables evil.

**Both are commanded together.** The prophet Micah makes this integration clear: "He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?" (Micah 6:8). Notice that Micah doesn't say "choose justice OR mercy" but commands us to "do justice AND love mercy." Both are required, and both serve the ultimate goal of walking humbly with God.

**Both serve love.** Justice protects love by establishing order and truth; mercy serves love by offering hope and redemption. Together, they create the conditions for authentic relationship with God and neighbor. As St. John Paul II taught: "Justice will only be fully established when people contribute to establishing it through love."

### The Perfect Integration

Perfect love integrates justice, truth, and mercy into one seamless reality:

- **Truth** reveals what is real about God, humanity, and moral order
- **Justice** gives each being what they are owed according to this truth
- **Mercy** offers forgiveness and grace that goes beyond what justice requires

This integration is what makes love "perfect"—it lacks nothing essential and excludes nothing good. It is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant that binds true justice and true mercy into life-giving communion.

When we cry out for justice, we are really crying out for this perfect love that honors truth, demands fairness, and offers mercy. This is why the universal cry for justice ultimately points us toward God, who alone perfectly integrates all three.

*Heavenly Father, You are perfectly just and perfectly loving. Help us to see every person as created in Your image and deserving of dignity and respect. Give us courage to defend the vulnerable, wisdom to discern true justice from its counterfeits, and hearts that cry out against injustice wherever we find it. May we be instruments of Your justice in our families, communities, and world, always remembering that true justice serves love and prepares the way for mercy. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.*

## Living the Response

The cry for justice is not merely something we observe—it's a call to action. As followers of Christ, we are called to be agents of justice in our families, communities, and world. Scripture provides clear guidance for how to live this calling.

**In Our Hearts:** Jesus taught that authentic justice begins within: "First take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye" (Matthew 7:5). We must examine our consciences regularly: Do we give God the worship He deserves? Do we treat others with the dignity they possess as image-bearers? Do we respect our own dignity through proper self-care and moral living?

**In Our Families:** Scripture calls us to practice justice first in our homes. This means keeping promises, treating family members fairly, and teaching children to recognize and respond to injustice. As Deuteronomy 6:6-7 commands: "These words that I command you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children."

**In Our Communities:** The prophets consistently called God's people to defend the vulnerable and speak truth in love. Isaiah 1:17 commands: "Learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless, plead the widow's cause." This means working for policies that protect human dignity from conception to natural death.

**In Our World:** Jesus calls us to be "salt of the earth" and "light of the world" (Matthew 5:13-14). This includes supporting organizations that fight human trafficking, defend religious freedom, protect the unborn, and promote authentic human development. Our justice must extend beyond our immediate circle to embrace all who bear God's image.

## Examen: Justice in Daily Life

**Morning:** Before beginning each day, ask yourself: "How can I give each person their due today? How can I honor God's image in myself and others?"

**Evening:** Reflect on the day: "Did I treat others with the dignity they deserve? Did I speak truth in love? Did I defend the vulnerable when I had the opportunity? Did I give God the worship and gratitude He deserves?"

**Weekly:** Consider your patterns: "Am I growing in my ability to recognize injustice? Am I becoming more courageous in defending what is right? Am I integrating justice and mercy in my relationships?"
