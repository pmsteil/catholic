## The Universal Cry That Reveals Our Nature

"That's not fair!"

These three words, spoken countless times by children on playgrounds and adults in boardrooms, reveal something profound about human nature. Whether it's a child protesting an unequal distribution of candy or an adult witnessing corruption in government, this instinctive cry emerges from the deepest part of our being. It's not learned behavior—it's written on our hearts.

This universal cry for justice and our need for peace and harmony reveals that we are created for moral order, not chaos. Every human being, regardless of culture, education, or background, possesses an innate sense that things *ought* to be fair, that people *ought* to be treated with dignity, and that wrongs *ought* to be made right. Scripture suggests this isn't mere social conditioning—it's evidence of our creation in the image of God, who is perfectly just. As St. Paul explains, even those without the written law "show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even defend them on the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge people’s hidden works through Christ Jesus." (Romans 2:15).

## What Children Know About Justice

Children demonstrate pure moral clarity about fairness before adults complicate justice with sophisticated theories:

**"That's not fair - you're being mean!"** Children instinctively recognize when someone is being treated badly without good reason and know that cruelty or favoritism based on arbitrary preferences violates human dignity.

**"Stop being mean to him!"** Children understand that using power to harm the weak is evil and expect authority figures to protect the vulnerable.

**"But you promised!"** Children know that breaking your word damages trust and violates justice—reliability and truthfulness are essential.

**"You're lying!"** Children expect honesty to be rewarded and lies exposed. They have an innate sense that reality matters and deception corrupts the moral order.

**"I didn't do it!"** Even when children lie to avoid punishment, their very attempt to escape consequences reveals their deep knowledge that wrongdoing deserves justice—they wouldn't hide if they didn't know they had done something that merited correction.

**"I'm telling!"** When children "tattle" on wrongdoers, they demonstrate their instinctive understanding that justice requires accountability—they expect authority figures to address wrongs and restore moral order.

These simple childhood expressions reveal profound truths about justice: that every person deserves dignity and protection, that promises create real obligations, that truth matters more than convenience, that wrongdoing has consequences, and that legitimate authority exists to restore moral order when it's broken. Children understand intuitively what philosophers spend lifetimes trying to explain—that justice isn't arbitrary human convention but flows from the very nature of humanity itself. There is no explanation in nature or evolution for why we should have this universal moral sense, yet every child possesses it from birth.

This reflects what St. Paul describes as "the law written on their hearts" (Romans 2:15). Jesus' command to "become like children" (Matthew 18:3) includes recovering this moral clarity that recognizes injustice immediately.

## The Nature of True Justice

Justice is not founded on human opinion, social convention or arbitrary laws—it flows from God's own nature and is written on every human heart through what we (philosophers dating all the way back to Aristotle in the 4th century BC) have come to call "natural law". The Catechism teaches us that "the natural law expresses the original moral sense which enables man to discern by reason the good and the evil" (CCC 1954).

There is the natural law that shows we desire moral order and not chaos and - and we have the intellect and will to reason and choose the good. Pair that with Jesus' revelations about what His radical love looks like and we have the foundation for "true justice", a well formed justice that has arguably led to the most flourishing of human societies.

#### Justice Defined

**Justice, at its core, is giving each person what they are owed according to their nature and dignity.** This classical definition, rooted in Scripture and Church teaching, reveals that justice has both negative and positive dimensions. As the Catechism teaches: "Justice is the moral virtue that consists in the constant and firm will to give their due to God and neighbor" (CCC 1807).

**Negative Justice (Avoiding Harm):**
The Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:1-17) establish the fundamental boundaries of negative justice:

*Justice Toward God:*
- **"I am the Lord your God; you shall not have strange gods before me"** - Giving God exclusive worship and refusing to worship created things instead of the Creator
- **"You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain"** - Never invoking God's name to justify what contradicts His nature of justice, mercy, and truth
- **"Remember to keep holy the Lord's Day"** - Giving God the worship and rest He commands

*Justice Toward Neighbor:*
- **"Honor your father and your mother"** - Giving reverence and care to those who gave us life
- **"You shall not murder"** - Respecting others' right to life
- **"You shall not commit adultery"** - Respecting the covenant bonds of marriage
- **"You shall not steal"** - Respecting others' right to property
- **"You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor"** - Respecting others' right to truth
- **"You shall not covet your neighbor's wife"** - Respecting the sanctity of women, marriage and family relationships
- **"You shall not covet your neighbor's goods"** - Respecting others' property and possessions

Negative justice establishes the minimum moral boundaries—what we must *not* do to God and others. It prevents harm and protects the dignity owed to God and neighbor. As St. Paul teaches: "Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore, love is the fulfilling of the law" (Romans 13:10).

**Positive Justice (Actively Doing Good):**
The Ten Commandments also include positive obligations, and Scripture calls us beyond mere avoidance of harm to active pursuit of good:

*Justice Toward Family and Authority:*
- **"Honor your father and your mother"** (Exodus 20:12) - Giving reverence and care to those who gave us life
- **"Give food to the hungry and drink to the thirsty"** (Matthew 25:35) - Providing for those in need
- **"Defend the weak and the fatherless"** (Psalm 82:3) - Protecting the vulnerable from exploitation
- **"Let the one who is taught the word share all good things with the one who teaches"** (Galatians 6:6) - Supporting those who share truth
- **"Bear one another's burdens"** (Galatians 6:2) - Offering support to those who suffer
- **"Love your enemies"** (Matthew 5:44) - Showing mercy to those who wrong us

Positive justice goes beyond avoiding harm to actively promoting human flourishing. It asks not just "What must I avoid?" but "What do I owe to others based on their dignity and my relationship to them?" The Catechism affirms: "Respect for the human person proceeds by way of respect for the principle that 'everyone should look upon his neighbor (without any exception) as another self'" (CCC 1931).

**True justice integrates both dimensions.** We cannot claim to be just if we merely avoid harming others while ignoring their legitimate needs. Nor can we claim to do good while simultaneously violating basic moral boundaries. Authentic justice requires both restraint from evil and active pursuit of the good. As Jesus teaches: "Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets" (Matthew 7:12).

### Divine Foundation of Justice

**God is perfectly just.** Justice flows from God's nature as the source of all moral order. As the Psalmist declares, "Justice and judgment are the foundation of your throne; mercy and faithfulness march before you" (Psalm 89:15). Moses confirms this truth: "The Rock—his work is perfect; yes, all his ways are just. A faithful God, without deceit, just and upright is he" (Deuteronomy 32:4). God's justice is not arbitrary but reflects His perfect knowledge of truth and His infinite love for creation. For without a justice that is firm, we cannot know "true love".

**Natural law written on hearts.** God has inscribed basic principles of justice on every human heart, which is why even those who don't know Scripture instinctively recognize certain actions as right or wrong. This universal moral sense proves that justice transcends cultural preferences.

**Objective moral order.** Right and wrong exist independently of human opinion. Justice is not determined by majority vote or cultural consensus but by the truth about human nature and our relationship to God.

### Justice Grounded in the Image of God

**The foundation of all authentic justice is the recognition that every human being is created in the image of God (Genesis 1:27). This truth transforms justice from mere social utility into sacred duty.** If this is true, we "ought" to seek the wisdom to enact the highest justice possible by looking to the author of justice, God, our loving Father.

#### How Rights Flow from Divine Duties

**Scripture doesn't speak of "rights" as modern culture understands them. Instead, it reveals the duties that God's justice requires us to practice toward all human beings. These duties, when universally applied, reveal what rights ought to exist.**

Consider how God's commandments create corresponding rights:

**"Thou shall not murder" (Exodus 20:13) → Right to Life:** Because God commands us to respect life in every person, each human being has a right to life from conception to natural death. This duty applies universally because every human life is sacred and bears God's image.

**"Honor your father and mother" (Exodus 20:12) → Right to Family:** Because God commands children to honor parents and parents to care for children, every child has a right to both mother and father, reflecting the complementarity of God's image in male and female.

**"You shall not bear false witness" (Exodus 20:16) → Right to Truth:** Because God commands us to speak truth to our neighbors, every person has a right to truth about reality, morality, and their ultimate destiny. We are rational beings made in God's image.

**"You shall not steal" (Exodus 20:15) → Right to Property:** Because God forbids theft, every person has a right to the fruits of their labor and the resources needed for human flourishing as stewards of creation.

**"You shall have no other gods before me" (Exodus 20:3) → Right to Worship:** Because God commands exclusive worship of Himself, every person has the right to worship their Creator and live according to their conscience.

**"Love your neighbor as yourself" (Mark 12:31) → Right to Freedom:** Because God commands us to love others as ourselves, every person has the right to authentic freedom—not license to sin, but freedom to choose the good and fulfill their nature as God's image-bearers.

**"Defend the weak and the fatherless" (Psalm 82:3) → Right to Protection:** Because God commands us to defend the vulnerable, every person has the right to protection from exploitation, abuse, and abandonment.

**"Feed the hungry, clothe the naked" (Matthew 25:35-36) → Right to Basic Needs:** Because God commands us to care for those in need, every person has the right to food, shelter, clothing, and healthcare necessary for sustaining human dignity and life.

**Every right carries a corresponding duty to sacrifice for our neighbors' good.** Interesting! 😊

#### The Objective Foundation of All Rights

**This understanding reveals that all authentic rights carry corresponding duties, and both flow from the firm, objective justice of God.** Rights aren't arbitrary human inventions or social contracts—they emerge from the moral order that God has written into creation itself.

When we ground justice in God's commandments applied universally to all image-bearers, we:
- Prevent dehumanization by recognizing every person's sacred dignity
- Stop utilitarian abuse by establishing duties we owe regardless of convenience
- Defend the vulnerable by making their protection a divine command
- Establish objective standards that reflect God's unchanging character
- Create a foundation for justice that transcends cultural preferences

**This is why the Church's social teaching is so powerful—it doesn't merely assert rights, but grounds them in the duties that flow from God's own justice toward His image-bearers.**

### Justice as Giving Each Their Due

True justice is fundamentally about **giving each being what they are owed** according to their nature, dignity, and relationship to us. This positive understanding goes far beyond merely avoiding harm—it actively seeks to honor the dignity and rights of every person.

**Justice Toward God:**
- **Worship and adoration** - God deserves our complete reverence as Creator and Lord
- **Obedience** - Following God's commandments as acknowledgment of His authority
- **Gratitude** - Recognizing all good things come from Him and giving thanks
- **Trust** - Believing in His goodness and providence even in difficulties

**Justice Toward Our Neighbor:**
- **Respect for dignity** - Treating every person as created in God's image
- **Honesty** - Speaking truth and keeping promises in all our dealings
- **Fairness** - Giving equal treatment regardless of personal preference
- **Protection** - Defending the innocent and vulnerable from harm

**Justice Toward Ourselves:**
- **Self-respect** - Honoring our own dignity as children of God
- **Self-discipline** - Ordering our desires according to reason and faith
- **Self-development** - Cultivating our talents for God's glory

## The Hierarchy of Justice: Biblical Foundation

Scripture reveals that different beings deserve different types and degrees of reverence, creating what we might call a proper ordering of our duties. This hierarchy isn't arbitrary but reflects the order established by God Himself:

### God First: The Great Commandment
> "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment." (Matthew 22:37-38)

Jesus establishes that our first duty of justice is to God—giving Him the supreme worship, adoration, and obedience He deserves as Creator and Lord.

### Parents and Authority: The Fourth Commandment
> "Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the Lord your God is giving you." (Exodus 20:12)

Scripture consistently places honor for parents and legitimate authority immediately after duties to God, showing their special place in the hierarchy of justice.

### Neighbor as Yourself: The Second Great Commandment
> "And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Matthew 22:39)

Jesus reveals that justice toward our neighbor must be measured by proper justice (and mercy) toward ourselves—neither neglecting our legitimate needs nor serving ourselves at others' expense.

### Civil and Religious Authority
> "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's." (Mark 12:17)
> "Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you." (Hebrews 13:17)

This shows that both civil and religious authority have a special place in the hierarchy of justice, with civil authority having the duty to protect the common good and religious authority having the duty to protect the faith.

### Creation Under Our Stewardship
> "And God said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.'" (Genesis 1:28)

Scripture shows that humans have a special responsibility for creation—not as owners but as stewards accountable to God.

This biblical ordering prevents the disorder that occurs when we give ultimate devotion to finite goods or treat unequal things as if they were equal. As Jesus warned, "No one can serve two masters" (Matthew 6:24).

## Jesus: The Perfect Integration of Justice and Mercy

Having established the divine foundation and proper ordering of justice, we can now see how Jesus perfectly demonstrates how justice and mercy work together in authentic love. Throughout the Gospels, we see Jesus embodying this perfect balance, never compromising either virtue.

### The Woman Caught in Adultery (John 8:1-11)

When the scribes and Pharisees brought the woman caught in adultery to Jesus, they sought to trap Him between justice and mercy. The Law demanded stoning (justice), but they expected Jesus to show mercy that would contradict the Law. Instead, Jesus demonstrated perfect integration:

**He acknowledged the demands of justice:** "Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her" (John 8:7). Jesus didn't dismiss the Law or claim adultery wasn't sinful.

**He offered transformative mercy:** "Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more" (John 8:11). His mercy wasn't permissiveness—it demanded repentance and transformation.

**He revealed deeper justice:** By exposing the accusers' own sinfulness, Jesus showed that true justice must begin with examining our own hearts.

### Zacchaeus: Justice Inspiring Generous Restitution (Luke 19:1-10)

When Jesus showed mercy to Zacchaeus the tax collector, notice what happened: Zacchaeus immediately responded with justice that went beyond legal requirements:

> "Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold." (Luke 19:8)

Jesus' mercy didn't excuse Zacchaeus's past injustices—it inspired him to make restitution that exceeded what the Law required (Exodus 22:1 required only double restitution for theft). True mercy awakens the desire for justice, not the excuse to avoid it.

### The Cleansing of the Temple (Matthew 21:12-13)

Jesus' cleansing of the temple shows that authentic love sometimes requires forceful justice:

> "And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. He said to them, 'It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you make it a den of robbers.'"

This wasn't anger contradicting love—it was love expressing itself through justice. Jesus' righteous anger protected the vulnerable (the poor being exploited) and defended the sacred (God's house being profaned). Sometimes love requires confronting injustice directly. But Jesus also showed mercy and restraint. He could have used his divine power to banish them, caused some physical harm, or even killed them. But He chose to show mercy and restraint.

### The Rich Young Man (Mark 10:17-22)

When the rich young man asked about eternal life, Jesus first pointed him to justice—keeping the commandments. But then He revealed that perfect love requires going beyond minimal justice:

> "You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me." (Mark 10:21)

Jesus showed that while justice establishes the foundation (keeping commandments), love calls us to generous sacrifice that serves others' needs. The young man's sadness reveals how difficult it is to move from mere justice to perfect love.

These Gospel examples show us that authentic justice and mercy don't compete—they complete each other in the perfect love that Jesus embodies.

## How Justice Serves Love

Justice is not opposed to love but is love's foundation. Without justice, love becomes mere sentiment; without love, justice becomes cold legalism. Perfect love requires both.

> "Justice without mercy is cruelty; mercy without justice is the mother of dissolution."
> — St. Thomas Aquinas

> "Love will always prove necessary, even in the most just society."
> — Pope Benedict XVI, *Deus Caritas Est*

**Creates Order:** Justice establishes the conditions in which love can flourish. When people know their rights will be respected and their dignity honored, they can trust enough to love.

**Protects the Vulnerable:** Justice defends those who cannot defend themselves, creating space for the weak to experience love without fear.

**Enables Trust:** Justice creates the reliability necessary for deep relationships. We can only love those we trust to treat us justly.

**Demands Truth:** Justice requires honesty about what is real and what is good. Love built on lies is not authentic love.

**Prepares for Mercy:** Justice establishes the moral order that makes mercy meaningful. Mercy is only beautiful when it transcends justice, not when it ignores it. As Isaiah proclaims, "Truly, the LORD is waiting to be gracious to you, truly, he shall rise to show you mercy; For the LORD is a God of justice: happy are all who wait for him!" (Isaiah 30:18). God's mercy flows from His perfect justice - true justice and mercy are intertwined!

## The Cry for Justice in Our Time

The universal cry for justice is particularly urgent in our contemporary world, where fundamental human rights face serious challenges:

> "Justice is both the aim and the intrinsic criterion of all politics. Politics is more than a mere mechanism for defining the rules of public life: its origin and its goal are found in justice, which by its very nature has to do with ethics."
> — Pope Benedict XVI, *Deus Caritas Est*

**Threats to Human Dignity:** When societies fail to recognize that every person is created in God's image, they risk treating some lives as less valuable than others. This affects the most vulnerable—the unborn, elderly, disabled, and poor.

**Breakdown of Family Structure:** Children thrive when raised in stable families with both mother and father. When this foundation is weakened, children suffer and society loses its most important institution for forming virtue.

**Economic Injustice:** The exploitation of workers and the extreme concentration of wealth can violate human dignity. Scripture consistently calls for fair wages and care for the poor.

**Religious Freedom:** The freedom to worship God according to conscience is fundamental to human dignity. When this freedom is restricted, people cannot fulfill their most basic duty of justice toward their Creator.

**Cultural Confusion:** When societies lose sight of objective moral truth, it becomes difficult to distinguish between authentic justice and its counterfeits.

Each of these challenges calls us to apply the principles of justice grounded in human dignity and ordered toward the common good.

## What Evil This Overcomes

The virtue of justice directly combats the evil of **dehumanization and exploitation**—the tendency to treat human beings as less than the image-bearers of God they truly are.

**Personal Evil:** Justice conquers the selfishness that ignores others' rights, the pride that demands special treatment, and the greed that exploits the vulnerable for personal gain.

**Relational Evil:** Justice heals broken trust, stops the cycle of revenge, and prevents the abuse of power that destroys families and friendships.

**Societal Evil:** Justice confronts systemic oppression, economic exploitation, and the cultural lies that deny human dignity based on race, class, or convenience.

**Spiritual Evil:** Justice defeats the fundamental lie that some human lives matter less than others, restoring the truth that every person bears God's image and deserves respect.

Without justice, love becomes mere sentiment that enables evil to flourish. With justice, love gains the backbone necessary to defend the vulnerable and create the order in which authentic relationships can thrive.

## Justice and the Integration of Body, Mind, and Soul

True justice requires the engagement of our entire being—body, mind, and soul working in harmony:

**Body:** Justice demands physical action—defending the vulnerable, working honestly, caring for our own health as stewards of God's gift, and using our strength to protect rather than exploit.

**Mind:** Justice requires clear thinking—studying moral principles, understanding natural law, discerning between authentic rights and false claims, and reasoning through complex ethical situations.

**Soul:** Justice flows from our spiritual relationship with God—recognizing His image in others, submitting to His moral order, and allowing His grace to transform our selfish hearts into instruments of His righteousness.

When body, mind, and soul are integrated in the pursuit of justice, we become effective agents of God's love in the world. When they are divided—when our actions contradict our beliefs, or our emotions override our reason—our pursuit of justice becomes compromised and ineffective.

*Heavenly Father, You are perfectly just and perfectly loving. Help us to see every person as created in Your image and deserving of dignity and respect. Give us courage to defend the vulnerable, wisdom to discern true justice from its counterfeits, and hearts that cry out against injustice wherever we find it. May we be instruments of Your justice in our families, communities, and world, always remembering that true justice serves love and prepares the way for mercy. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.*

## Living the Response

The cry for justice is not merely something we observe—it's a call to action. As followers of Christ, we are called to be agents of justice in our families, communities, and world. Scripture provides clear guidance for how to live this calling.

**In Our Hearts:** Jesus taught that authentic justice begins within: "First take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye" (Matthew 7:5). We must examine our consciences regularly: Do we give God the worship He deserves? Do we treat others with the dignity they possess as image-bearers? Do we respect our own dignity through proper self-care and moral living?

**In Our Families:** Scripture calls us to practice justice first in our homes. This means keeping promises, treating family members fairly, and teaching children to recognize and respond to injustice. As Deuteronomy 6:6-7 commands: "These words that I command you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children."

**In Our Communities:** The prophets consistently called God's people to defend the vulnerable and speak truth in love. Isaiah 1:17 commands: "Learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless, plead the widow's cause." This means working for policies that protect human dignity from conception to natural death.

**In Our World:** Jesus calls us to be "salt of the earth" and "light of the world" (Matthew 5:13-14). This includes supporting organizations that fight human trafficking, defend religious freedom, protect the unborn, and promote authentic human development. Our justice must extend beyond our immediate circle to embrace all who bear God's image.

## Examen: Justice in Daily Life

**Morning:** Before beginning each day, ask yourself: "How can I give each person their due today? How can I honor God's image in myself and others?"

**Evening:** Reflect on the day: "Did I treat others with the dignity they deserve? Did I speak truth in love? Did I defend the vulnerable when I had the opportunity? Did I give God the worship and gratitude He deserves?"

**Weekly:** Consider your patterns: "Am I growing in my ability to recognize injustice? Am I becoming more courageous in defending what is right? Am I integrating justice and mercy in my relationships?"
