## Project Overview

This is a Catholic devotional book project titled "What Is Love?, God's Perfect Love" - a comprehensive exploration of authentic love as the Catholic answer to the problem of evil. The project is structured as a multi-part book covering various facets of love, virtues, and spiritual development from a Catholic perspective.

## Project Structure

- **Main Directory**: `/book1_v3/` - Contains the current version of the book project
- **Outline Files**: Multiple outline files for different parts and chapters (e.g., `book1_v3_outline.md`, `book1_v3_outline_part_01.md`, etc.)
- **Chapter Files**: Individual chapter markdown files (e.g., `01_Chapter_01.md`)
- **Outlines Subdirectory**: `/outlines/` - Contains detailed chapter outlines and part summaries
- **Reference Materials**:
  - `write-book-prompt-v3.md` - Master writing guidelines and workflow
  - `book1-blogpost-for-catholics.md` - Writing style reference

## Book Development Workflow

The book follows a systematic phased approach:

1. **Part Summaries**: Create overview summaries for each book part in `/outlines/` directory
2. **Chapter Outlines**: Generate detailed chapter outlines following the structure defined in `write-book-prompt-v3.md`
3. **Chapter Drafts**: Expand outlines into full chapters (2,000-2,500 words each)

### Progress Tracking System
- `[]` = Not Started
- `[O]` = Outline Generated (Ready for Review)

## Central Book Themes

**Core Definition of Love**: "Perfect Love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and true mercy into life-giving communion."

**Target Audience**: Everyday Catholics seeking to deepen their understanding and practice of authentic love

**Book Purpose**: Provide a Catholic answer to the problem of evil by exploring comprehensive, authentic love as revealed through Catholic teaching

## Chapter Structure Requirements

Each chapter follows a specific structure:
- Opening (Key Scripture Verse, Key CCC References)
- Biblical and Church Teaching
- Vices associated with the virtue
- When Counterfeit Love Fails (contemporary distortions)
- Three Questions to Ask
- Practical Application
- Closing (Chapter Takeaway, Test Questions, Reflection Question)
- Additional Study (Scripture, Catechism, Papal Encyclicals)
- Prayer Practice

## Writing Guidelines

- **Length**: 2,000-2,500 words per chapter
- **Tone**: Personal, direct, relatable, evangelistic/apologetic
- **Style Reference**: Use `book1-blogpost-for-catholics.md` as style guide
- **Scripture**: Always use NABRE translation
- **Citations**: Include CCC references, quotes from saints, popes, and theologians
- **Approach**: "Bite-sized theology" - substantial but accessible content

## File Management

- Individual chapter files use naming convention: `##_Chapter_##.md`
- Outline files use naming convention: `##_part_##_chapter.md` in `/outlines/` directory
- Part summaries use naming convention: `##_part_00.md` in `/outlines/` directory
- Always reference the master outline file `book1_v3_outline.md` for overall structure

## Quality Standards

- Maintain doctrinal accuracy to Catholic teaching
- Address contemporary cultural challenges and counterfeits to authentic love
- Include practical applications for daily Catholic life
- Integrate comprehensive coverage of virtues, vices, and spiritual development
- Ensure narrative flow and cohesion across chapters while allowing each to stand alone
