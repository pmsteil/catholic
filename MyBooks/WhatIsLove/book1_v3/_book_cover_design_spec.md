**What Is Love?**

### Subtitle
*God’s Perfect Love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant, binding truth, justice, and mercy, into life-giving communion.*

### Author
Patrick Steil, St. John Paul II University Parish, Denton TX

### Spine Text
*What Is Love? • Patrick Steil*

### Back Cover Blurb (new)
"Society is unraveling. Politicians lie without shame. Media manufactures truth. Schools teach children they can choose their gender while adults can't define what a woman is. Courts abandon law for political agendas. 'Justice' has become revenge. 'Mercy' enables destruction.

What is happening to our world?

This book reveals the shocking answer: We're witnessing justice and mercy severed from their source. As Christianity's influence fades, these virtues—meant to heal—have become weapons of division. We cry for justice but deliver mob rule. We preach mercy but enable evil. We demand love but can't define it.

The solution isn't another ideology. It's a return to the Author of truth, justice, and mercy—to discover what love actually IS. Not sentiment. Not tolerance. Not faith alone. But God's Perfect Love: the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant that binds truth, justice, and mercy into life-giving communion.

This isn't a theology textbook. It's a battle cry for all Catholics to start living the radical love that can save our bleeding world.

God's Perfect Love isn't just the answer. It's the only force powerful enough to heal what we've broken."

## Catholic Imagery (Final)

**Primary focal point**
- Crucifix with the Sacred Heart of Jesus — Christ on the Cross at center; His Heart visible and radiant (pierced/aflame), from which light and streams emanate (Truth + Mercy together).

**Covenant & Church**
- Three interwoven strands (rope-like) forming a church-shaped arch around the Crucifix (Trinity, covenant bond, Church as shelter of love).

**Justice (foundation)**
- Altar of stones beneath the Cross — rough-hewn stones forming a stable altar, the foundation of justice, upon which mercy flows and truth shines.

**Atmosphere**
- Radiance and flowing lines emanating from Christ’s Heart, downward and outward, covering the altar (mercy fulfilling justice, truth illuminating covenant).

**Hierarchy (to keep it minimalist)**
- Bold: Crucifix + Sacred Heart
- Subtle: Covenant arch, stone altar
- Atmospheric: Radiance/streams

## Layout

**B. Altar Ascent (Vertical Procession)**
- Stone altar at lower third, Cross rising from it.

- Cross + Heart inside a circular medallion, wrapped by three-strand arch (double framing).
- Altar simplified (single stone course).
- Title large; subtitle tighter; more negative space for reverence.

### **Book Cover Design Brief (Updated Final Version)**

**Book Title:** *What Is Love?*

**Dimensions:** 6x9 inches

**Color Palette:**
* **Background color:** Maroon (the color of dried blood). Overlaid on this color is a subtle, darker, tone-on-tone pattern that evokes classic baroque damask or wallpaper.
* **Artwork & Text color:** Gold Torch
**Style:** The overall style should be baroque art suitable for a book cover.

**What the imagery is trying to convey:**

The imagery should visually represent "God's Perfect Love" which is the sacred, sacrificial gift which binds truth+justice+mercy into life-giving communion.

**Typography**

* **Title:** “What Is Love?” at the top of the cover. **Font:** Cinzel Decorative.
* **Edition:** “First Edition” at the bottom in a very small point size.**Font:** Libre Baskerville.
    - there should be no other text on the cover

1.  **Crucifix and Eucharist:** The primary image is a crucifix. A large, but simple and semi-transparent **Eucharistic host** is positioned BEHIND the crucifix's crossbar.

2. **Three Rays** Eminating from the Eucharist Host are soft, wide, semi-transparent rays emanating from it in a 360-degree pattern all the way to the edges of the image (but behind the pillars/archway). IMPORTANT: These rays should not be solitary rays, but should be connected in threes, symbolizing how Truth, Justice, and Mercy must emanate together from Jesus out to the world. The rays should be WIDE. The rays going into the chalice should also be a group of 3 rays and should stop at the chalice, not going below it.

2.  **Altar and Chalice:** Beneath the crucifix is a rugged, old, and traditional **stone altar**, evocative of catacomb altars. A solitary **chalice** rests upon it and there should be no other elements on the altar. The altar should be a single stone course with engraved deeply into the front of the altar: "Deus Caritas Est". The altar should be positioned directly below the crucifix. The altar should be placed on top of a stone base 3 levels high.

3.  **The Pillars & Arch:** Eminating from the bottom stone base of the altar the central scene is framed by  two **pillar-like bases** which then form into an archway. The arch itself is formed from three interwoven and tightly coupled strands, representing Truth, Justice, and Mercy.
