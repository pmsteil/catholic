##### What Is Communion?

**The Ultimate Goal of All Love**
Communion is the perfect union of persons in truth and love - the goal toward which all authentic love tends. It is not mere togetherness or emotional closeness, but the complete gift of self that creates genuine unity while preserving the dignity and uniqueness of each person. Communion is both the source and the summit of authentic love.

**Three Dimensions of Communion:**
1. **Communion with God** - The primary relationship that orders all others
2. **Communion with Neighbor** - Authentic human relationships flowing from divine love
3. **Communion with Self** - Interior integration of body, mind, and soul in harmony with God's will

**The Trinitarian Foundation**
Perfect communion exists eternally within the Trinity - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in perfect unity of nature while maintaining the distinctness of Persons. This divine communion is the source and model for all created communion. We are called to participate in the very life of God.

##### How Communion Integrates All Facets of Love

**The Trinity's Perfect Gift in the Crucifixion and Eucharist**

**Truth and Communion**
- Communion requires complete honesty and transparency
- No authentic unity can be built on deception or half-truths
- Truth creates the foundation of trust necessary for genuine communion
- In communion, we know and are known fully, without pretense or mask
- The Eucharist reveals the ultimate truth: God's infinite love for each person

**Justice and Communion**
- Communion gives each person their full due as beloved children of God
- Perfect justice recognizes the infinite dignity of each person
- Justice creates the order and respect necessary for authentic communion
- In communion, each person receives the love they deserve as image-bearers of God
- The Eucharist satisfies divine justice while opening the floodgates of mercy

**Mercy and Communion**
- Communion forgives all wounds and heals all divisions
- Mercy enables communion despite human weakness and sin
- Perfect mercy restores broken relationships to their intended wholeness
- In communion, mercy triumphs over judgment while maintaining truth
- The Eucharist is the fountain of mercy that enables authentic communion with God and neighbor

**Sacrifice and Communion**
- Communion requires the complete gift of self for the good of the other
- Perfect sacrifice creates perfect unity through total self-donation
- Sacrifice breaks down the barriers of selfishness that prevent communion
- In communion, sacrifice becomes joy because love gives itself freely
- The Eucharist teaches us that perfect love is perfect sacrifice, and perfect sacrifice creates perfect communion

**The Magnitude of What We Have Been Given**

Christ's Crucifixion, made present in every Eucharist, is the perfect revelation of how the Trinity gives us all the facets of authentic love. In this supreme act of love, we see:

- **The Father's Truth:** Revealing the full truth of His love for humanity and the reality of sin's consequences
- **The Son's Justice:** Paying the debt of justice that humanity owed, satisfying divine justice perfectly
- **The Holy Spirit's Mercy:** Applying the fruits of redemption to souls, enabling forgiveness and healing no matter how grave the sin
- **The Trinity's Sacrifice:** The complete self-gift of God for the salvation of the world

This is why the Eucharist is the source and summit of our faith - it contains and makes present the perfect integration of Truth, Justice, Mercy, and Sacrifice and all the facets of love that flow from the very life of the Trinity. At every Mass, we participate in this divine love and learn more deeply about its infinite depths.

We live in the shadow of the Cross, breathing the very air of redemption, yet how easily we forget the cosmic magnitude of this gift. Without Christ's sacrifice—without this perfect integration of Truth, Justice, Mercy, and Sacrifice made present in every Eucharist—humanity would be trapped in an unbreakable cycle of evil. There would be no objective Truth, only the tyranny of subjective opinion. There would be no perfect Justice, only the arbitrary rule of power and the endless spiral of revenge. There would be no divine Mercy, only the crushing weight of guilt, shame, and consequences that multiply across generations. There would be no redemptive Sacrifice, only the selfishness that destroys families, communities, and souls.

In such a world, authentic love as we have defined it—the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant-binding truth, justice, and mercy into life-giving communion—would be impossible. Evil would reign supreme because there would be no divine standard to measure it against, no divine power to overcome it, and no divine hope to sustain the fight against it. Children would inherit only brokenness from their parents, with no possibility of redemption or healing. The vulnerable would have no ultimate protector, the guilty no ultimate forgiveness, the lost no ultimate home.

But Christ has changed everything. Through His perfect sacrifice, the Trinity has given us everything we need for authentic love: objective Truth that cannot be manipulated, perfect Justice that satisfies all debts, infinite Mercy that heals all wounds, and redemptive Sacrifice that transforms suffering into salvation. This is why the Mass is not merely a ritual but the very heartbeat of civilization—the source from which all authentic love flows and the summit toward which all human longing tends. In a world increasingly hostile to these truths, the Eucharist stands as humanity's last, best hope for authentic communion with God, neighbor, and self.

**The Miracle of the Church: Christ's Gift Across the Centuries**

And what a miracle that Jesus did not leave us orphans! He established His Church—one, holy, catholic, and apostolic—to develop, preserve, and transmit these life-giving truths across the centuries. For over 2000 years, through persecution and triumph, through the rise and fall of empires, through every form of cultural upheaval, the Church has faithfully handed down this perfect integration of Truth, Justice, Mercy, and Sacrifice. What seemed impossible—that divine love could be preserved intact across millennia—has become the greatest miracle of human history.

This means that we, living today, can actually rise up against the moral evil consuming our world. We are not defenseless against the lies that destroy families, the injustices that oppress the vulnerable, the mercilessness that hardens hearts, or the selfishness that tears apart communities. We have been given the ultimate weapon against evil: the truth and charity of Christ crucified as an act of sacrificial LOVE. We "fight" not with hatred, violence, or political power, but with the same sacrificial love that conquered death itself. Every Mass equips us for this spiritual warfare. Every reception of the Eucharist arms us with divine love. Every act of authentic charity strikes a blow against the kingdom of darkness.

The Church's preservation of these truths is not merely historical—it is our lifeline in the present battle. When the world tells us that truth is relative, the Church proclaims objective Truth. When society embraces revenge and power, the Church offers Justice tempered by Mercy. When culture promotes selfishness, the Church calls us to redemptive Sacrifice.

THIS IS WHY THE GATES OF HELL CANNOT PREVAIL AGAINST THE CHURCH: SHE CARRIES WITHIN HERSELF THE VERY LOVE OF THE TRINITY, THE COMPLETE ANSWER TO EVERY FORM OF EVIL THAT HAS EVER EXISTED OR EVER WILL EXIST.

##### The Eucharist: Source and Summit of Communion

**Christ's Perfect Gift**
The Eucharist is the perfect expression of communion - Christ's complete self-gift that enables our participation in divine life. In the Eucharist, Christ gives us His Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity, holding nothing back. This perfect gift creates perfect communion.

**The Mass as School of Communion:**
- **Gathering Rite:** Overcoming isolation to become one body
- **Liturgy of the Word:** God speaks to unite our minds and hearts in truth
- **Offertory:** We offer our lives to be united with Christ's sacrifice
- **Eucharistic Prayer:** The perfect prayer of communion with the Trinity
- **Communion:** We receive Christ and become what we receive
- **Dismissal:** Sent forth to live this communion in the world

**Effects of Eucharistic Communion:**
- Increases sanctifying grace
- Unites us more closely to Christ
- Separates us from sin
- Strengthens the bonds of charity
- Preserves us from future mortal sins
- Creates unity among the faithful
- Commits us to service of the poor

##### Marriage: Earthly Image of Divine Communion

**Covenant Communion**
Marriage is the earthly sacrament that most perfectly images the communion between Christ and His Church. In marriage, two persons become "one flesh" while maintaining their distinct identities, creating a communion of life and love ordered toward the procreation and education of children.

**How Marriage Images Divine Communion:**
- **Exclusive:** Like God's love for His people
- **Permanent:** Reflecting God's eternal faithfulness
- **Fruitful:** Participating in God's creative power
- **Sacrificial:** Imaging Christ's love for the Church
- **Sacramental:** Making divine love visible in the world

**The Family as Domestic Church**
The family formed by marriage becomes a "domestic church" - a communion of persons that images the Trinity and prepares children for eternal communion with God. Parents are called to be the first teachers of faith, hope, and love.

##### Communion and the Mystical Body of Christ

**One Body, Many Members**
The Church is the Mystical Body of Christ, a communion of all the faithful - living and dead, on earth, in purgatory, and in heaven! This communion transcends time and space, uniting all who are incorporated into Christ through Baptism.

**The Communion of Saints:**
- **Church Militant:** The faithful on earth, fighting against sin
- **Church Suffering:** The souls in purgatory, being purified
- **Church Triumphant:** The saints in heaven, interceding for us
- **Perfect Communion:** All united in Christ's love

**Our Lady as Model of Communion**
Mary is the perfect model of communion - her "fiat" created perfect communion with God's will, enabling the Incarnation. She is the Mother of the Church, drawing all her children into deeper communion with her Son.

##### Obstacles to Communion and How Love Overcomes Them

**What Evil This Overcomes:**
Communion conquers the fundamental evil of division and separation that entered the world through sin. This includes:

- **Spiritual Division:** Separation from God through sin
- **Personal Division:** Interior conflict between body, mind, and soul
- **Relational Division:** Broken relationships, hatred, unforgiveness
- **Social Division:** Class warfare, racism, nationalism, tribalism
- **Ecclesial Division:** Schism, heresy, scandal within the Church
- **Cosmic Division:** The disorder introduced by original sin

**How Communion Heals Division:**
- Restores the original harmony intended by God
- Creates unity while respecting diversity
- Builds bridges across all human divisions
- Establishes peace through justice and mercy
- Enables forgiveness and reconciliation
- Witnesses to the power of divine love

##### Living in Communion: Practical Applications

**Daily Practices of Communion:**
- **Morning Offering:** Beginning each day in communion with God's will
- **Family Prayer:** Creating domestic communion through shared worship
- **Eucharistic Adoration:** Deepening personal communion with Christ
- **Works of Mercy:** Extending communion to those in need
- **Forgiveness:** Restoring broken communion through mercy
- **Hospitality:** Welcoming others into communion of love

**Communion in Different States of Life:**
- **Married Couples:** Living covenant communion ordered toward the good of your children
- **Single Persons:** Preparing for marriage or religious life through communion with God
- **Religious:** Witnessing to ultimate communion through vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience
- **Clergy:** Serving as instruments of communion through sacramental ministry
- **All Christians:** Called to be leaven of communion in a divided world

##### The Eschatological Dimension: Perfect Communion in Heaven

**The Beatific Vision**
Perfect communion will be achieved in heaven through the Beatific Vision - seeing God face to face. This is the ultimate goal of all human longing, the perfect satisfaction of our deepest desire for union with infinite Love.

**The Resurrection of the Body**
At the end of time, our bodies will be resurrected and reunited with our souls, creating perfect communion of the entire human person. This bodily resurrection affirms the goodness of material creation and the integrity of human nature.

**The New Heaven and New Earth**
God will create "a new heaven and a new earth" where perfect communion will reign forever. Death, suffering, and division will be no more. All creation will be restored to its original harmony and elevated to participate in divine life.

##### Communion as the Answer to the Problem of Evil

**The Ultimate Victory**
Communion is God's ultimate answer to the problem of evil. Where evil divides, communion unites. Where evil destroys, communion creates. Where evil brings death, communion brings life. Perfect communion is the complete victory over all forms of evil.

**The Promise of Christ**
Christ promised: "That they may all be one, as you, Father, are in me and I in you, that they also may be in us, that the world may believe that you sent me" (John 17:21). This communion is not just a future hope but a present reality that grows through grace.

**Our Mission**
We are called to be instruments of communion in a divided world - to heal divisions, build bridges, create unity, and witness to the power of divine love. Every act of authentic love contributes to the building of God's Kingdom of perfect communion.

##### Conclusion: The Heart of the Gospel

Communion is the heart of the Gospel - God's invitation to participate in the very life of the Trinity. Through the Incarnation, Passion, Death, and Resurrection of Jesus Christ, the way to perfect communion has been opened. Through the sacraments, especially the Eucharist, this communion is made available to all.

The call to communion is the call to sainthood - to become so united with God that we become instruments of His love in the world. This is the ultimate meaning of human existence: to know, love, and serve God in this life, and to be happy with Him forever in the next, in perfect communion with all the saints.

> "For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but might have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him will not be condemned, but whoever does not believe has already been condemned, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. And this is the verdict, that the light came into the world, but people preferred darkness to light, because their works were evil. Everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come toward the light, so that his works might not be exposed. But whoever lives the truth comes to the light, so that his works may be clearly seen as done in God." — John 3:16-21

The forgiveness of sins on the Cross allows us to live in communion with God and with our neighbor.

### The Call to Perfection: Understanding God's Justice and Mercy in Sin

Jesus calls us to nothing less than perfection: *"So be perfect, just as your heavenly Father is perfect"* (Matthew 5:48). This call to perfection is not impossible—it is the call to communion with Him. But we must understand that God's perfect justice and mercy means that not all sins are equal in their offense against love.

**The Distinction Between Mortal and Venial Sin:**

St. Paul teaches us clearly that some sins are more grievous than others: *"All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that is not deadly"* (1 John 5:17). He warns us about sins that exclude us from the Kingdom: *"Do you not know that the unjust will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor boy prostitutes nor practicing homosexuals nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor robbers will inherit the kingdom of God"* (1 Corinthians 6:9-10).

**God's Perfect Justice Distinguishes:**
- **Mortal sins** are grievous affronts to God's justice and mercy that sever our relationship with Him—they involve grave matter, full knowledge, and deliberate consent
- **Venial sins** weaken our relationship with God but do not destroy the life of grace within us
- God's perfect justice means He cannot look upon all sins as equal—His justice demands proper distinctions

**The Path to Perfection:**
We can achieve the perfection Jesus calls us to by:
- **Avoiding mortal sin completely** through God's grace and the sacraments
- **Striving to avoid venial sin** as well, recognizing that even small offenses against love orient us away from God and back toward selfishness
- **Regular confession** to maintain and restore our friendship with God
- **Growing in virtue** so that our hearts become more aligned with His perfect love

This is not legalism but love—understanding that every sin, whether grave or light, is a turning away from the perfect love that God desires to share with us. The closer we draw to His perfect justice and mercy, the more sensitive we become to anything that might separate us from Him.

Imagine a world where every person is living with this framework. I will try to wake up every day and follow God's perfect justice and mercy as best I can.  When I fall, I will try to repent and grow.  I will try to be a witness to the possibility of authentic love.  Imagine the transformation of the world.  There would be no more wars, no more oppression, no more loneliness, no more betrayal, no more division, no more greed, no more despair, no more fear of death, no more separation from God.  Yes this is pie in the sky, but it is actually possible, this is why Jesus tells us to take this good news to all nations.

But even if may seem impossible, does ANY other religion, philosophy, or worldview offer an equal or better hope for the transformation of the world?

### The Call to Action: Become Saints

This book is not merely an intellectual exercise—it is a call to transformation. Jesus and His Church call us to become saints, to embody this perfect love in our own lives and circumstances.

**For Families with Children:**
- Live your family as a covenant of love ordered toward the good of your children
- Practice chastity, faithfulness, and mutual submission
- Make your home a sanctuary where love conquers evil daily
- Raise your children to know and live authentic love
- Raise your children to become saints

**For Single Persons:**
- Prepare for marriage or religious life through the practice of virtue
- Use your freedom to serve others and build the Kingdom
- Practice chastity as preparation for total self-gift
- Be a witness to the possibility of authentic love

**For Religious and Clergy:**
- Live your vows as a radical witness to the primacy of divine love
- Shepherd others toward authentic love through word and example
- Make the sacraments available as God's response to evil
- Be fathers and mothers to those entrusted to your care

**For All Christians:**
- **Live sacramentally** - order your life around Mass and the sacraments
- **Practice the virtues** - make them habits, not occasional acts
- **Defend the truth** - especially about marriage, family, and human dignity
- **Serve the poor** - see Christ in the least of these
- **Evangelize** - share this perfect love with a world dying from counterfeits

**Make your life a living prayer:** "Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven."

**Make your family a domestic church** where love conquers evil daily and children learn to be missionaries of love.

**Make your work a vocation** to serve God and neighbor, bringing Christ's salvation to your workplace.

**Make your suffering redemptive** by uniting it with Christ's passion for the salvation of souls.

**Make your joy infectious** by sharing the Good News of God's love with everyone you meet by shining light into the darkness of their lives.

**Make your witness bold** in proclaiming that Jesus Christ is the answer to every human longing and the solution to every form of evil.

The world is waiting for saints. The world is waiting for missionaries of love. The world is waiting for you to join Jesus in His mission to save the world.

**"Be it done unto me according to your word."** — Luke 1:38

*Let this be your response to God's call to perfect love and to the New Evangelization. The salvation of the world depends on your "yes" each and every day.*

**Our Mission is Christ's Mission**
Jesus came not to condemn but to save. His mission is our mission: to be instruments of salvation in a world that desperately needs the light of authentic love. The same Truth, Justice, Mercy, and Sacrifice that saved us through the Cross must now flow through us to save others. We are called to be living extensions of the Incarnation, bringing Christ's saving love to every corner of the world.

**The New Evangelization: Sharing the Gift We Have Received**
As Pope John Paul II proclaimed and Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis have continued, we are living in the age of the "New Evangelization"—not just maintaining our faith, but actively sharing it with renewed ardor, methods, and expression. The salvation Jesus won for us on the Cross is not something to hide but the greatest gift we can offer to a world dying from counterfeit loves.

Jesus saving us from the actual consequences of sin—eternal death, spiritual darkness, broken relationships, meaningless suffering—is the most important news in human history. In whatever place God sends us, we are called to share this light with those still trapped in darkness.

Go forth and love as Christ loved:
- **Sacrificially** - giving your life for others as Jesus gave His life for you
- **Truthfully** - speaking and living the truth in love, bringing light to those in darkness
- **Justly** - giving each person what they are due as beloved children of God
- **Mercifully** - forgiving as you have been forgiven, offering God's mercy to the wounded
- **Faithfully** - keeping your covenant promises as witnesses to God's faithfulness
- **Hopefully** - trusting in God's ultimate victory and sharing that hope with the despairing
- **Joyfully** - knowing that love has already won and sharing that joy with the world
