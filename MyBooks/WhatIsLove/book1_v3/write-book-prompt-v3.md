# Writing a Devotional Book from Outline

## Objective

Systematically generate a devotional book by expanding the provided outline into individual markdown files for every designated chapter, following a phased workflow approach.

## Input:

1.  **Master Outline:** `./book1_v3/book1_v3_outline.md` (Contains the overall structure and chapter titles).
2.  **Writing Style Reference:** `./book1_v3/book1-blogpost-for-catholics.md`.

## Output:

1.  **Detailed Outline Points:** `./book1_v3_outlines/` directory (Contains the detailed outline points for each chapter).
2.  **Devotional Book:** `./book1_v3/` folder which will contain one file per chapter.

## Writing Style and Guidelines

**Writing Style Reference:** Use the provided `./book1_v3/blog1-blogpost-for-catholics.md` as a reference for writing style, tone, and approach. Incorporate relevant content, examples, and anecdotes from this blog post where appropriate throughout the draft.

**Target Audience:** Everyday Catholics may not have a deep understanding of the Laws of Love given to us by Jesus and the overall Truths of the Catholic Faith. This is not a theological book, but a devotional book that helps Catholics understand the Laws of Love and the Truths of the Catholic Faith so that they can love their Lord more deeply and be a light in the darkness of society.

**Core Purpose:** To help everyday Catholic Christians deepen their understanding, digestion, and practice of authentic love (grounded in the unity of truth, justice, and mercy), enabling them to love their Lord more deeply and be a light in the darkness of society. This devotional book should equip Catholics to become laser-focused in the practice of their faith, engage confidently with contemporary cultural challenges, and implicitly demonstrate how true faith works through love (countering "faith alone" narratives and so many other counterfeit forms of 'love' - marxism, wokeism, etc.).

**Desired Tone:** Personal, direct, relatable, and passionately evangelistic/apologetic (similar to the `./book1_v3/blog1-blogpost-for-catholics.md`) but clear and without church jargon, true to doctrine and teaching, but down to earth. Use "we" and "us" frequently to connect with the reader. Maintain a sense of hope and confidence in the beauty and truth of the Catholic faith.

**Visual Elements:** Add any tables, diagrams, charts, etc. where appropriate to make the content more engaging and easier to understand. If a photo or graphic is suggested to help explain a concept, add a placeholder for the graphic to be added later.

**Narrative Flow and Cohesion:** Maintain awareness of the overall book structure outlined in `./book1_v3/book1_v3_outline.md` and the progress tracked below. Each chapter should stand alone, but can reference other chapters for additional context. Each chapter should contribute to the book's progressive argument that love is a multi-faceted gift of God and narrative arc.

**Central Truths to be integrated where appropriate:**
* All human beings are made in the image and likeness of God.
* The human being is a composite of body, mind and soul.
* The human being is made for love.

**Central Definition of Love (Integrate Throughout):**

> **Perfect Love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and true mercy into life-giving communion.**
> _(Shorter form: Love is the unity of God's true justice and true mercy.)_
> _(Shortest form: God is Love.)_


*   **Application:** Consistently use this definition as a lens to analyze topics in every chapter. Regularly ask variations of: "How does this teaching/sacrament/virtue reveal the _sacred/sacrificial/covenantal/binding/truth/justice/mercy/life-giving/communion_ aspect of God's love?" Use blockquotes for emphasis on this definition when reintroduced.



## Chapter Structure (Narrative with Devotional Elements):
Each chapter's narrative draft should follow this structure:

**Opening:**

*   Start with one (or more) most relevant **Key Scripture Verse**. Always use NABRE and always print the entire verse.Format the verse and reference like so:

Example: **Key Scripture Verse**: "We know that the whole creation has been groaning in travail together until now." -- _Romans 8:22_

*   Add in the most relevant **Key CCC Reference(s)** for the chapter like:

Example: **Key CCC Reference(s)**: Temperance: Moderates attraction of pleasures, provides balance, ensures will's mastery over instincts. -- CCC 1809


**Biblical and Church's Teaching:**
*   Start with a definition of the facet of love (virtue) for the chapter. Always stick to Catholic teaching on the facet of love (virtue).
*   Develop the chapter's theme (facet of love) based on the approved chapter outline points, using the narrative style and tone defined above.
*   Show an example of how a child understands the chapter's facet of love intuitively (if applicable, don't make a stretch. This will be more applicable to Part 1A and 1B virtues)
*   Whenever possible, integrate other relevant Scripture and CCC references naturally within the text where needed to support points.
*   Whenever possible, integrate in relevant quotes (in blockquotes) from Catholic saints (especially St. Catherine of Sienna, St. Faustina Kowalska, St. Teresa of Avila, St. Thérèse of Lisieux, St. Bernard of Clairvaux, St. Mary Magdalene de’ Pazzi), theologians (especially St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas), Popes (especially Pope St. John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis) to enrich the body. Make sure to document the year of the quote or author.

**Vices:**
*   Give a bulleted list and short description of the vices associated with the facet of love (virtue) for the chapter.

**When Counterfeit Love Fails:**

*   Explain up to 3 of the most contemporary and common distortions that happen when this virtue is missing (if applicable) - point out how missing this virtue may end up in common misguided ideologies and practices and name them such as sentimentalism, critical theory, intersectionality, wokeness, relativism, liberalism, individualism, feminism, Marxism/Socialism/Communism, postmodernism, sexualism and gender ideology, divorce, politicalism, materialism, scientism, non-Christian world religions, etc.
*   Make an empathetic case for why people might be drawn to these ideologies (the half truths offered by these ideologies) and why we should care enough to share in a most charitable way the Catholic vision of love with them.

**Three Questions to Ask:**
*   Provide up to three charitable, thought provoking questions the reader could ask someone to help them see the flaws in the counterfeit love and get to the core truth of this facet of love.

**Practical Application:**
*   Provide up to three practical applications the reader could use to live out this facet of love in their daily life.

**Closing:**

*   **Chapter Takeaway:** A concise summary of the chapter's main point.
*   **Test your knowledge:** Give 2 questions to test the reader's understanding of how this facet of love relates to justice and then to mercy.
*   **Reflection Question:** One deep, thought-provoking question related to the chapter's facet of love for personal reflection.

**Additional Study:**
*   **Scripture:** List a few additional relevant Scripture references.
*   **Catechism:** List a few additional relevant CCC paragraph numbers.
*   **Papal Encylicals:** List a few additional relevant papal encyclical(s). Make sure to document the year of the encyclical.

**Prayer Practice:**
*   Per the outline suggest a fitting Catholic spiritual/devotional practice explicitly linking the chapter's facet of love to the prayer's intention (e.g., understanding the facet more deeply, praying for the Salvation of the World, developing the facet of love). If the prayer is not the Rosary, The Our Father, Hail Mary or Glory Be, provide a brief explanation of the prayer's significance and how it relates to the chapter's facet of love and include the entire text of the prayer.

## Drafting Workflow and Progress Tracking

**Tracking Markers:**

*   `[]`: Not Started
*   `[O]`: Outline Generated (Ready for User Review)


**Using Previous Chapter Outlines:**

* For each chapter in the book1_v3 outline, there is a corresponding "Previous Chapter" number indicated in the outline table.
* These previous chapter outlines can be found in the `./book1_v2/outlines/` directory with filenames like `XX_ChXX_outline.md` where XX is the chapter number.
* When creating a new chapter outline:
  1. First review the corresponding previous chapter outline from book1_v2
  2. Use it as a reference point and foundation, but adapt and update it according to the new structure and focus defined in this prompt
  3. Ensure the new outline maintains the core theological concepts but aligns with the central definition of love and the chapter structure defined in this prompt
  4. If the previous chapter outline contains valuable examples, analogies, or quotes, incorporate these where appropriate
  5. The new outline should be an improvement and refinement, not just a copy of the previous version

**Workflow Steps:**

1.  **Select Next Part/Chapter:** Identify the next chapter/part marked `[]` in the "Outline Progress" list below.
2.  **If the next section is a part to generate:** Create a summary of the part and write it to a new file in the `./book1_v3/outlines/` directory (e.g. for Part 1: `./book1_v3/outlines/01_part_00.md`, for Part 2: `./book1_v3/outlines/02_part_00.md`, etc.). Include relevant scripture quotes and a narrative summary of the chapters in the part.
3.  **If the next section is a chapter to generate:** Extract relevant points from the master outline (`./book1_v3/book1_v3_outline.md`) and the structure noted in the 'Chapter Structure'. Structure these points logically for the specific chapter/part. Write this detailed plan to a new file in the `./book1_v3/outlines/` directory (e.g. for Part1, Chapter 1: `./book1_v3/outlines/01_part_01_chapter.md`, for Part1, Chapter 2: `./book1_v3/outlines/01_part_02_chapter.md`, etc.).
4.  **Mark as Outlined:** Update the tracking list below, changing the chapter's/part's status from `[]` to `[O]`.
5.  **Start the outline for the next chapter/part.**
