We are creating a book cover for a book called "What Is Love?".

General style: 2-dimensional, catholic art style.

Here are the instructions for creating each layer of the book cover graphic.

### **Image Layer 1: Background**

**Instruction for this layer:** A book cover background featuring a solid maroon color, similar to dried blood, with a subtle, tone-on-tone darker maroon baroque simple and subtle fleur-de-lis (randomly placed and sized in different shades to style them) pattern overlaid.  The book cover will be printed on a matte paper. The book size is 6" x 9". The background should be 100% of the image.




### **Image Layer 2: Eucharistic Host**

**Instruction for this layer:**  On top of Layer 1, add a small, simple washed out gold Eucharistic host, positioned 1/3 from the top of the image. The host should not have anything on it and should produce no glow. This element will be behind a crucifix which we will add in the next layer.



### **Image Layer 3: Crucifix**

**Instruction for this layer:** Do not change the previous layer except for placement if needed.Now on top of Layer 2, add a simple crucifix with a silhouette of Jesus in a 2-dimensional art style, rendered in the same gold color as the host, but more vibrant. This is the primary central image, positioned in front of a Eucharistic host with the crossbar of the crucifix overlapping the center of the host.

### **Image Layer 4: Segmented Rays**

**Instruction for this layer:** Now on top of Layer 3, add soft, wide, translucent rays composed of three separate lines/rays/segments (depicting each ray is filled with God's truth+justice+mercy where one of the three is stonger). The rays are a very subtle, off-white/golden glow and emanate from a central point, extending in a 360-degree pattern to the edges of the image.

### **Image Layer 5: Title/Subtitle Text**

**Instruction for this layer:** Now on top of Layer 4, add the words "What Is Love?" in a Gold Torch color, positioned at the top of a book cover. "What is" is on one line and "Love" is on the next line in a standard size. The text should be small and not overlap with the central crucifix or rays.  At the bottom of the book cover, add the words "Deus Caritas Est" (which means "God is Love" in Latin), in a chiseled looking font.
