# üìò Ruthless Editing Checklist ‚Äì No Mercy Pass

This file is a **progress tracker** for editing the manuscript.
The editor must work through it **in waves**, starting from largest structural issues down to smallest line-level fixes.
Stop after each wave for me to review.
Use emoji status indicators for progress: ‚¨ú = not started, üü® = in progress, ‚úÖ = complete.

## Additional Instructions

- Scripture should use ONLY NABRE with full book names (e.g., ‚ÄúJohn 3:16‚Äù), no abbreviations (‚ÄúJn 3:16‚Äù)?
- Edit method: Do you want me to make direct edits to chapter files, or leave inline editorial comments (e.g., [ED: ‚Ä¶]) and log changes under ‚ÄúProgress Log‚Äù per wave?
- Priority order: proceed strictly 1‚Äì13?
- Tone target: If we must choose in edge cases, should I bias toward pastoral readability or academic rigor? - Pastoral readability for sure.
- If you find additional recommendations, make note of the chapter and line number in the file.

            ‚Ä¢ Evil originates in human hearts when we choose sin over love
            ‚Ä¢ Sin chooses our good at others' expense; love chooses others' good at our expense
            ‚Ä¢ Perfect love is the complete answer to the problem of evil

            ‚Ä¢ Understanding love's complete definition liberates us from idolatry and counterfeits
        - Chapter 3: Justice
            ‚Ä¢ Justice gives each person their due according to their dignity as God's image-bearers
            ‚Ä¢ True justice must integrate with mercy to avoid becoming cruelty
            ‚Ä¢ The universal cry for fairness reveals our divine origin and moral nature
        - Chapter 4: Mercy
            ‚Ä¢ Mercy chooses healing over harm, restoration over revenge
            ‚Ä¢ The Sacrament of Reconciliation provides tangible mercy and healing
            ‚Ä¢ Mercy breaks cycles of hurt and creates space for redemption
        - Chapter 5: Truth
            ‚Ä¢ Truth is the foundation that prevents justice and mercy from becoming distorted
            ‚Ä¢ The Church has Christ's authority to teach truth definitively
            ‚Ä¢ Truth liberates love from sentiment and grounds it in reality
        - Chapter 6: Sacrifice
            ‚Ä¢ Sacrifice transforms love from theory into action
            ‚Ä¢ Christ's sacrifice perfectly integrates expiation (justice) and oblation (mercy)
            ‚Ä¢ The Eucharist unites our daily sacrifices with Christ's perfect offering
        - Chapter 7: Covenant
            ‚Ä¢ Covenant creates permanent bonds that secure all other virtues
            ‚Ä¢ God's covenant history reveals the pattern for human relationships

            ‚Ä¢ Each sacrament addresses specific needs for growth in holiness
            ‚Ä¢ The sacramental life transforms us from within through grace
        - Chapter 9: The Cross and Resurrection
            ‚Ä¢ The Cross reveals love's perfect sacrifice; Resurrection reveals love's victory
            ‚Ä¢ Every facet of perfect love converges in the Paschal Mystery
            ‚Ä¢ Christ's death and resurrection make authentic love possible for us

            ‚Ä¢ The Eucharist makes Christ's perfect sacrifice present at every Mass
            ‚Ä¢ Holy Communion transforms us into living sacrifices of love
            ‚Ä¢ The Mass is the source and summit where we learn to love as Christ loves
        - Chapter 11: Counterfeit Love
            ‚Ä¢ Counterfeits separate truth, justice, and mercy instead of integrating them
            ‚Ä¢ Denying humans are made in God's image leads to catastrophic evil
            ‚Ä¢ Understanding authentic love helps us recognize and resist counterfeits
