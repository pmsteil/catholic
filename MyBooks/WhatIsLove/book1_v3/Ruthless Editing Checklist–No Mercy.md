- Priority order: proceed strictly 1–13?
- Tone target: If we must choose in edge cases, should I bias toward pastoral readability or academic rigor? - Pastoral readability for sure.

    - Add your notes on the key thing the reader will learn in each chapter (short 2-3 bullet list is great)
        - Chapter 1: Evil
            • Evil originates in human hearts when we choose sin over love

            • The Mass is the source and summit where we learn to love as Christ loves
        - Chapter 11: Counterfeit Love
            • Counterfeits separate truth, justice, and mercy instead of integrating them
            • Denying humans are made in God's image leads to catastrophic evil
            • Understanding authentic love helps us recognize and resist counterfeits

## 🌊 Wave 3 – Style & Voice ✅ COMPLETED
