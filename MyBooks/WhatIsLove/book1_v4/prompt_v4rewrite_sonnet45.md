# Book v4 Rewrite Prompt for "What Is Love?: God's Perfect Love"

## Overview

This prompt provides comprehensive instructions for creating version 4 of "What Is Love?: God's Perfect Love" - a focused, theologically precise exploration of authentic love as the complete Christian answer to the problem of evil.

**Key Shift in v4:** While written by a Catholic for all Christians, this version uses the comprehensive definition of God's Perfect Love to explain and invite readers into the fullness of Catholic faith. The book demonstrates how Catholic practices (Mass, Sacraments, etc.) flow naturally from the definition of love itself, making them accessible and compelling to all Christians.

## Core Definition

**God's Perfect Love is the sacred gift of covenant which binds truth, justice, mercy, and sacrifice into life-giving communion.**

This definition serves as the foundation for the entire book and will be systematically unpacked in Part 1, then applied to key Christian questions in Part 2.

## Book Structure

### Part 1: Unpacking God's Perfect Love (Chapters 1-11)
**Purpose:** Systematically break down each component of the definition to show how authentic love provides the complete answer to evil.

1. **Chapter 1: The Problem of Evil** - Establishes the fundamental problem that only love can solve
2. **Chapter 2: The Answer is Love** - Introduces the comprehensive definition as God's solution
3. **Chapter 3: Sacred** - God as the source of all love; love's divine origin
4. **Chapter 4: Gift of Covenant** - Permanent, binding relationships through voluntary acceptance of God's authority
5. **Chapter 5: Binding** - Love unites and integrates disparate elements into harmonious whole
6. **Chapter 6: Truth** - Love requires objective reality and cannot exist in deception
7. **Chapter 7: Justice** - Love gives what is due according to dignity
8. **Chapter 8: Mercy** - Love transcends justice with compassionate forgiveness
9. **Chapter 9: Sacrifice** - Love requires self-giving action, not mere sentiment
10. **Chapter 10: Life-giving** - Love creates, sustains, and multiplies life
11. **Chapter 11: Communion** - Love builds authentic community and relationship

### Part 2: Applications to Christian Faith (Chapters 12-14)
**Purpose:** Show how this definition solves key Christian problems, explains Catholic practices, and demonstrates the integration of virtues and vices.

12. **Chapter 12: Proof for the Existence of God** - Upgraded moral argument showing problems with Divine Command Theory
13. **Chapter 13: The Nature of Virtues—Faith Working Through Love** - Comprehensive matrix showing how all virtues uphold the four pillars; refutes "faith alone" by demonstrating faith requires truth, justice, mercy, and sacrifice at every stage
14. **Chapter 14: Understanding Sin—Mortal and Venial Distinctions** - How vices deny the four pillars; refutes "all sin is the same"; explains three conditions for mortal sin; shows growth in holiness is possible

## Writing Approach

### Audience and Tone

**Primary Audience:** All Christians (Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox) seeking theological clarity about love

**Author Perspective:** Written by a Catholic who wants to draw all Christians into the fullness of Catholic faith by showing how it flows naturally from God's Perfect Love

**Tone Characteristics:**
- Scholarly but accessible, direct and clear
- Evangelistic and apologetic, but leading readers to conclusions rather than imposing them
- Invitational rather than confrontational
- Uses "we" language to include all Christians in the journey
- Confident in Catholic truth while respectful of Protestant readers

**Catholic Elements - How to Handle:**
- **DO include:** Mass, Sacraments, CCC references, Catholic practices
- **DO explain:** Why these exist based on the definition (e.g., "We have Mass because love requires sacrifice—this is where we participate in Jesus' sacrifice")
- **DO NOT avoid:** Catholic distinctives, but present them as the natural fulfillment of what all Christians seek
- **DO NOT assume:** Readers understand Catholic terminology—explain clearly

### Chapter Style

**Length:** 1,500-2,500 words per chapter
- Focused on theological precision
- No devotional fluff or repetitive applications
- Dense with meaning but accessible in language

**Structure:** Each chapter should:
- Stand alone as a complete theological argument
- Build logically on previous chapters
- Contribute one clear piece to the overall thesis
- Lead naturally to the next chapter

**Focus:**
- Theological depth and biblical foundation
- Logical argumentation and philosophical rigor
- Clear explanation of how this facet of love combats specific evils
- Connection to Catholic practice when relevant

### Minimalist Approach - What to Eliminate

**Remove from v3 chapters:**
- ❌ "Living the Response" sections with daily/weekly/monthly practices
- ❌ Chapter prayers (opening and closing)
- ❌ Examen sections with reflection questions
- ❌ "What Children Know" sections (too devotional)
- ❌ Repetitive application examples
- ❌ "For the Love of Children" pastoral sections

**Keep and strengthen:**
- ✅ Opening epigraphs (Scripture + Church teaching/saints)
- ✅ Core theological content and biblical exegesis
- ✅ Scripture references with brief relevance notes (use NABRE translation exclusively)
- ✅ CCC paragraph citations (explained as "historic Christian teaching")
- ✅ Logical argumentation and philosophical depth
- ✅ "Further Study" sections (Scripture, Catechism, Christian Thinkers)
- ✅ Callouts as needed to provide biblical and CCC backing for key claims

- Not an arbitrary addition to faith, but Jesus' own words about inheriting eternal life

### Chapter 3: Sacred - God as the Source of All Love

**Core Thesis:** Love originates from God and participates in divine nature, not human invention or evolutionary accident.

**Key Elements:**
- **God is Love (1 John 4:8, 16):** Not just that God loves, but that love IS God's very nature
- **Sacred vs. Profane:** What makes love "sacred" rather than merely natural or cultural

  - Davidic covenant (2 Samuel 7)
  - New Covenant in Christ's blood (Luke 22:20, Hebrews 8-9)
- **Covenant vs. Contract:**
  - Contracts are conditional and temporary
  - Covenants are unconditional and permanent
  - Covenants create family bonds, not business arrangements
- **God's Authority Properly Understood:**

  - **BUT:** Voluntary acceptance of the Author of Love's design
  - God's "authority" comes from being the Author of truth, justice, mercy

**Theological Depth:**
- Free will and consent essential to covenant

  - Love creates harmony without uniformity
  - Respects differences while creating unity
- **Love as Binding Force in Relationships:**

## Part 2 Chapter Specifications

### Chapter 12: Proof for the Existence of God

**Core Thesis:** The moral argument demonstrates God's existence through human capacity for love; this definition provides an upgraded moral argument that avoids Divine Command Theory problems.

**Key Elements:**
- **The Moral Argument:**
  1. Objective moral values and duties exist
  2. If objective moral values and duties exist, God exists
  3. Therefore, God exists
- **Love as Evidence:**
  - Our definition shows love requires: sacred source, sacrifice, covenant, truth, justice, mercy, life-giving, communion
  - These cannot be grounded in materialism, evolution, or human convention
  - Only God can ground such comprehensive, objective love
- **Critique of Divine Command Theory:**
  - **Problem:** "Is something good because God commands it, or does God command it because it's good?"
  - **DCT Answer:** Good because God commands it (arbitrary)
  - **Our Answer:** God commands it because it flows from His nature as Love
  - God doesn't arbitrarily command; He reveals His own nature
  - Love is not arbitrary but rooted in God's eternal, unchanging nature
- **Atheism's Inability to Ground Love:**
  - Evolutionary psychology reduces love to survival mechanism
  - Utilitarianism makes love arbitrary calculation
  - Relativism destroys love's objectivity
  - Nihilism admits love is illusion
- **How the Definition Supports the Argument:**
  - Each facet of love points to transcendent source
  - Integration requires intelligent design
  - Objective moral obligations require personal God

**Theological Depth:**
- Natural law as participation in eternal law
- How reason can know God exists (Romans 1:20)
- Relationship between faith and reason
- Why atheism is ultimately incoherent about love

**Catholic Practice Connection:**
- Why Church uses philosophy (faith seeking understanding)
- Natural theology and revealed theology
- How we can dialogue with non-believers

**Scripture Focus:** Romans 1:18-20, Romans 2:14-15, Acts 17:22-31, Psalm 19:1-4

**Key Enhancements Made:**
- Added "the end of this view" for each atheistic position (nihilism, moral skepticism, moral paralysis, totalitarian sacrifice)
- Rewrote all seven facets of love with concrete scenarios that force atheists to confront their own moral intuitions (spouse's affair, murdered child, firefighter's sacrifice, etc.)
- Added "Does love exist?" as fundamental question alongside "Does God exist?"
- Emphasized love as universal law requiring a lawgiver
- Added "give credit where credit is due" appeal to intellectual honesty
- Expanded atheist's dilemma to show they appeal to truth, justice, mercy, and sacrifice constantly
- Added Queen reference ("crazy little thing called love") for accessibility

**Completion Checklist:**
- [X] Moral argument clearly presented
- [X] Divine Command Theory critique included
- [X] Love as evidence developed with concrete examples
- [X] Atheism's inability to ground love shown with logical ends
- [X] "Does love exist?" question integrated
- [X] Love as universal law emphasized
- [X] Final review complete

### Chapter 13: The Nature of Virtues—Faith Working Through Love

**Core Thesis:** Every virtue upholds and flows from the four pillars of perfect love (Truth, Justice, Mercy, and Sacrifice). This comprehensive matrix demonstrates that faith must work through love, integrating all four pillars at every stage of the Christian life—definitively refuting "faith alone."

**Key Elements:**
- **Virtues Matrix:** Complete table showing how all virtues (theological, cardinal, capital, and additional) relate to the four pillars
- **Why Every Virtue Requires Sacrifice—Even Faith:**
  - 1 Corinthians 13:13: "The greatest of these is love"
  - 1 Corinthians 13:2: Faith without love is nothing
  - James 2:17, 24: Faith without works is dead; justified by works, not faith alone
  - What authentic faith demands in terms of truth, justice, mercy, and sacrifice
- **Justification: Not a Single Moment, But an Ongoing Process:**
  - Before Conversion: Faith requires all four pillars even to come to initial faith
  - At Conversion: "Giving your life to the Lord" requires integrating all four pillars
  - After Conversion: Ongoing justification (Philippians 2:12) requires continuous integration

### Chapter 14: Understanding Sin—Mortal and Venial Distinctions

**Core Thesis:** Every vice denies or distorts the four pillars of perfect love. Sin has degrees of gravity—not all sins are equal. Understanding the distinction between mortal and venial sin is essential for growing in holiness and demonstrates that we can, by God's grace, avoid mortal sin and become saints.

**Key Elements:**
- **Vices Matrix:** Complete table showing how all vices (opposing theological/cardinal virtues, seven deadly sins, additional vices) offend against the four pillars
- **How Vices Offend Against the Four Pillars:**
  - Offenses against truth (denying reality about God, self, others, right/wrong)
  - Offenses against justice (failing to give what's due)
  - Offenses against mercy (hardening hearts, refusing forgiveness)
  - Offenses against sacrifice (choosing selfishness)
- **Refuting "All Sin Is the Same":**
  - Common misinterpretation of Scripture (James 2:10, Romans 3:23, 1 John 1:8)
  - Fuller reading in context shows degrees of sin
  - Jesus teaches we can choose good (Luke 10:27-28)
  - Paul: "Conquer evil with good" (Romans 12:21)
  - God's perfect love integrates truth, justice, and mercy in allowing us to choose and be forgiven
- **Scripture Clearly Teaches Distinction:**
  - 1 John 5:16-17: Deadly vs. non-deadly sin
  - 1 Corinthians 6:9-10: Specific sins exclude from Kingdom
- **The Three Conditions for Mortal Sin (CCC 1857-1859):**
  - Grave matter (seriously wrong act)
  - Full knowledge (knowing it's seriously sinful)
  - Deliberate consent (freely choosing to do it)
  - All three must be present for mortal sin
- **Detailed Examples: Same Vice at Different Levels:**
  - Lying: Social lie → serious lie → perjury (with T/J/M/S analysis)
  - Anger: Brief irritation → nursing grudges → planning revenge
  - Greed: Wanting more → hoarding → exploiting the poor
  - Lust: Brief thought → deliberate fantasy → pornography → adultery
- **Seven Deadly Sins: Capital Vices That Lead to Death:**
  - Why they're called "deadly" (root sources of other sins)
  - How each progressively destroys relationship with God/neighbor/self
  - Progressive nature: temptation → consent → habit → hardening → mortal sin → spiritual death
- **Mitigating and Aggravating Factors:**
  - What reduces culpability (ignorance, fear, passion, addiction, habit)
  - What increases gravity (hypocrisy, scandal, abuse of authority, cruelty, premeditation)
  - Circumstances matter (taking $5 from millionaire vs. widow vs. collection basket)
- **Sacrament of Reconciliation: Restoration to Grace:**
  - What mortal sin does (kills sanctifying grace)
  - What confession does (restores grace)
  - Three acts of penitent (contrition, confession, satisfaction)
  - Seal of confession
  - When to go to confession
- **Examination of Conscience Guide:**
  - Questions for each pillar
  - Assessing gravity using the three conditions
  - Simple examination based on Ten Commandments
- **Growing in Holiness:**
  - We CAN avoid mortal sin through God's grace
  - We CAN reduce venial sin progressively
  - We CAN choose good consistently
  - We CAN become saints
  - God created us with free will and capacity to choose good
  - Saints prove it's possible (Mary Magdalene, Augustine, Francis, Ignatius, Paul)
  - 10 practical steps for growth

**Theological Depth:**
- Mortal vs. venial sin distinction
- Three conditions for mortal sin
- Culpability and freedom
- Grace and human cooperation
- Growth in holiness as real possibility

**Apologetic Power:**
- Definitively refutes "all sin is the same" error
- Shows Scripture teaches degrees of sin when read in context
- Demonstrates we can grow in holiness (not trapped in perpetual sin)

## Conclusion

This prompt provides the comprehensive framework for creating a focused, theologically rigorous v4 that serves all Christians while inviting them into the fullness of Catholic faith. The book demonstrates that Catholic teaching and practice flow naturally from God's Perfect Love, making them accessible and compelling to any Christian who takes Scripture seriously.

The goal is not to water down Catholic distinctives but to show how they make sense within the comprehensive definition of love that all Christians can affirm. By systematically unpacking the definition and applying it to key Christian questions, the book builds a bridge from Protestant to Catholic understanding while maintaining theological integrity and biblical fidelity.

Every chapter should leave readers thinking: "This makes sense. This is what I've been looking for. This is the fullness of what I already believe but couldn't articulate." And ultimately: "I want to explore the Catholic Church that teaches and embodies this love."
