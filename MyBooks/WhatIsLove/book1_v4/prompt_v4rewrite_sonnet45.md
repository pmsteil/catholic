# Book v4 Rewrite Prompt for "What Is Love?: God's Perfect Love"

## Overview

This prompt provides comprehensive instructions for creating version 4 of "What Is Love?: God's Perfect Love" - a focused, theologically precise exploration of authentic love as the complete Christian answer to the problem of evil.

**Key Shift in v4:** While written by a Catholic for all Christians, this version uses the comprehensive definition of God's Perfect Love to explain and invite readers into the fullness of Catholic faith. The book demonstrates how Catholic practices (Mass, Sacraments, etc.) flow naturally from the definition of love itself, making them accessible and compelling to all Christians.

## Core Definition

**God's Perfect Love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant, binding truth, justice, and mercy, into life-giving communion.**

This definition serves as the foundation for the entire book and will be systematically unpacked in Part 1, then applied to key Christian questions in Part 2.

## Writing Approach

### Audience and Tone

**Primary Audience:** All Christians (Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox) seeking theological clarity about love

**Author Perspective:** Written by a Catholic who wants to draw all Christians into the fullness of Catholic faith by showing how it flows naturally from God's Perfect Love

**Tone Characteristics:**
- Scholarly but accessible, direct and clear
- Evangelistic and apologetic, but leading readers to conclusions rather than imposing them
- Invitational rather than confrontational
- Uses "we" language to include all Christians in the journey
- Confident in Catholic truth while respectful of Protestant readers

**Catholic Elements - How to Handle:**
- **DO include:** Mass, Sacraments, CCC references, Catholic practices
- **DO explain:** Why these exist based on the definition (e.g., "We have Mass because love requires sacrifice—this is where we participate in Jesus' sacrifice")
- **DO NOT avoid:** Catholic distinctives, but present them as the natural fulfillment of what all Christians seek
- **DO NOT assume:** Readers understand Catholic terminology—explain clearly

### Chapter Style

**Length:** 1,500-2,500 words per chapter
- Focused on theological precision
- No devotional fluff or repetitive applications
- Dense with meaning but accessible in language

**Structure:** Each chapter should:
- Stand alone as a complete theological argument
- Build logically on previous chapters
- Contribute one clear piece to the overall thesis
- Lead naturally to the next chapter

**Focus:**
- Theological depth and biblical foundation
- Logical argumentation and philosophical rigor
- Clear explanation of how this facet of love combats specific evils
- Connection to Catholic practice when relevant

### Minimalist Approach - What to Eliminate

**Remove from v3 chapters:**
- ❌ "Living the Response" sections with daily/weekly/monthly practices
- ❌ Chapter prayers (opening and closing)
- ❌ Examen sections with reflection questions
- ❌ "What Children Know" sections (too devotional)
- ❌ Repetitive application examples
- ❌ "For the Love of Children" pastoral sections

**Keep and strengthen:**
- ✅ Opening epigraphs (Scripture + Church teaching/saints)
- ✅ Core theological content and biblical exegesis
- ✅ Scripture references with brief relevance notes (use NABRE translation exclusively)
- ✅ CCC paragraph citations (explained as "historic Christian teaching")
- ✅ Logical argumentation and philosophical depth
- ✅ "Further Study" sections (Scripture, Catechism, Christian Thinkers)
- ✅ Callouts as needed to provide biblical and CCC backing for key claims

- **God's Authority Properly Understood:**

  - **BUT:** Voluntary acceptance of the Author of Love's design
  - God's "authority" comes from being the Author of truth, justice, mercy

**Core Thesis:** The moral argument demonstrates God's existence through human capacity for love; this definition provides an upgraded moral argument that avoids Divine Command Theory problems.

**Key Elements:**
- **The Moral Argument:**
  1. Objective moral values and duties exist
  2. If objective moral values and duties exist, God exists
  3. Therefore, God exists

- **Critique of Divine Command Theory:**
  - **Problem:** "Is something good because God commands it, or does God command it because it's good?"
  - **DCT Answer:** Good because God commands it (arbitrary)

### Chapter 14: "Faith Alone" vs "Faith Working Through Love"

**Core Thesis:** Biblical faith necessarily produces works of love; "salvation" means learning to love like Christ, not merely "going to heaven." Faith can never stand "alone" because it encompasses all of God's truth, justice, and mercy.

**Key Elements:**
- **Redefining "Salvation":**
  - **NOT:** Just "going to heaven when you die"
  - **BUT:** Being transformed to love as God loves
  - Jesus came to teach us how to love in truth, justice, and mercy
  - His mission: fulfill law and prophets by demonstrating perfect love on the cross
  - We see His example and learn to love like He did
  - "Be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect" (Matthew 5:48)
  - **Return to Luke 10:25-28:** Jesus says loving God, neighbor, and self is how to "inherit eternal life"—this IS salvation
- **Why "Faith Alone" is Insufficient:**
  - Faith encompasses all of God's truth + justice + mercy
  - These cannot stand "alone"—they require integration
  - Faith without love is dead (James 2:17)
  - "If I have all faith... but do not have love, I am nothing" (1 Corinthians 13:2)
- **Addressing "We Can't Be Perfect" Objection:**
  - **First:** We cannot have any doctrine that makes Jesus' own words null, void, or contradictory
  - **Second:** Jesus doesn't demand perfection as "never even have a bad thought"
  - **Third:** Paul and the Church's teaching on mortal vs. venial sin shows the path:
    - Mortal sin: Damages/breaks relationship with God (grave matter, full knowledge, deliberate consent)
    - Venial sin: Wounds but doesn't destroy relationship with God
    - "Be perfect" means avoiding mortal sin—living in right relationship with God
  - **Fourth:** Jesus looks at us with proper truth + justice + mercy
  - He knows our abilities and limitations as human beings
  - He gives us a realistic way to live into the "be perfect" model
  - Perfection = maintaining covenant relationship through grace, not sinless performance
  - This is why we have Confession—to restore relationship when we fall into mortal sin
- **Biblical Exegesis:**
  - **James 2:14-26:** "Faith without works is dead"
  - **Galatians 5:6:** "Faith working through love"
  - **1 Corinthians 13:** Love is greater than faith
  - **Matthew 7:21:** "Not everyone who says 'Lord, Lord'..."
  - **Matthew 25:31-46:** Judgment based on works of love
- **Paul's Teaching Properly Understood:**
  - Not saved by "works of the law" (Jewish ceremonial law)
  - But saved for good works (Ephesians 2:8-10)
  - Faith produces fruit (Galatians 5:22-23)
  - Love is the fulfillment of the law (Romans 13:10)
- **How Definition Explains the Relationship:**
  - Faith believes the truth about God's love
  - Hope trusts in God's promises
  - Love enacts what faith believes
  - All three are necessary (1 Corinthians 13:13)
- **The Cross as Culmination:**
  - Jesus demonstrated the entire definition on the cross
  - Sacred (divine love), Sacrificial (gave His life), Covenant (New Covenant in His blood)
  - Binding truth (revealed God's nature), justice (satisfied debt), mercy (forgave sins)
  - Life-giving (resurrection), Communion (reconciled us to God)
  - This is what we're saved INTO, not just saved FROM

**Theological Depth:**
- Justification and sanctification
- Faith, hope, and love as theological virtues
- Difference between merit and grace
- How grace enables works

**Apologetic Approach:**
- Lead readers to conclusion through biblical evidence
- Show internal contradictions in "faith alone" doctrine
- Demonstrate how Catholic teaching makes better sense of Scripture
- Invite Protestant readers to reconsider

**Catholic Practice Connection:**
- Why we have sacraments (grace to love)
- Why we confess sins (acknowledging failure to love)
- Why we do works of mercy (living out our faith)
- How Mass forms us in love

**Scripture Focus:** James 2:14-26, Galatians 5:6, 1 Corinthians 13:1-13, Matthew 25:31-46, Ephesians 2:8-10, Romans 13:8-10

### Chapter 16: The World Needs God's Perfect Love

**Core Thesis:** Only authentic love can heal society's divisions and call Christians to unity in the One Church that teaches this love through every doctrine, sacrament, and practice.

**Key Elements:**
- **Cultural Counterfeits of Love:**
  - Sentimental love (feelings without commitment)
  - Romantic love (passion without permanence)
  - Sexual love (pleasure without procreation)
  - Tolerant love (acceptance without truth)
  - Social justice love (activism without mercy)
  - Each counterfeit takes one aspect and distorts it
- **Major Lies Destroying Society Today:**
  - **Abortion:** Violates truth (human life begins at conception), justice (right to life), mercy (for the vulnerable), life-giving (destroys life), communion (breaks family bonds)
  - **Transgenderism:** Violates truth (biological reality), justice (what's due to body), binding (separates body from identity), life-giving (sterilization), communion (confusion about fundamental identity)
  - **Marxism/Socialism/Communism:** Violates truth (human nature), justice (property rights), covenant (family bonds), communion (replaces with state control)
  - **Irresponsible "Free Speech":** Calling people Nazis/fascists without evidence, inciting violence, accepting violent protests—violates truth (false accusations), justice (slander), mercy (hardness of heart), communion (destroys civil discourse)
  - All are misapplications of truth + justice + mercy
  - Young people and politicians pushing these lies need to hear authentic love
- **Division in Christianity:**
  - Thousands of Protestant denominations
  - Disagreement on fundamental issues
  - Lack of visible unity Jesus prayed for (John 17:21)
  - How division weakens Christian witness
- **Call to Unity in Truth:**
  - Jesus prayed "that they may be one" (John 17:21)
  - Unity requires truth (can't unite around error)
  - Unity requires authority (who decides truth?)
  - Unity requires visible expression (not just "spiritual")
- **How Definition Provides Common Ground:**
  - All Christians affirm God is love
  - All Christians recognize need for truth, justice, mercy
  - All Christians value sacrifice, covenant, communion
  - This definition can unite what division has separated
- **The Catholic Church as Fullness:**
  - **Invitation, not condemnation:** "Come and see" (John 1:46)
  - Church teaches this love through:
    - Every paragraph of the Catechism
    - Every doctrine and dogma
    - Every sacrament (especially Eucharist)
    - Every devotion
    - Every Mass
  - Not claiming Catholics are better, but that Catholic teaching is complete
  - Protestant brothers and sisters have much truth, but not fullness
- **Overcoming Evil with Good (Romans 12:21):**
  - Only love can defeat evil
  - Only united Church can effectively witness to love

## Conclusion

This prompt provides the comprehensive framework for creating a focused, theologically rigorous v4 that serves all Christians while inviting them into the fullness of Catholic faith. The book demonstrates that Catholic teaching and practice flow naturally from God's Perfect Love, making them accessible and compelling to any Christian who takes Scripture seriously.

The goal is not to water down Catholic distinctives but to show how they make sense within the comprehensive definition of love that all Christians can affirm. By systematically unpacking the definition and applying it to key Christian questions, the book builds a bridge from Protestant to Catholic understanding while maintaining theological integrity and biblical fidelity.

Every chapter should leave readers thinking: "This makes sense. This is what I've been looking for. This is the fullness of what I already believe but couldn't articulate." And ultimately: "I want to explore the Catholic Church that teaches and embodies this love."
