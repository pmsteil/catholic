"Society is unraveling. Politicians lie without shame. Media manufactures truth. Schools teach children they can choose their gender while adults can't define what a woman is. Courts abandon law for political agendas. 'Justice' has become revenge. 'Mercy' enables destruction.

What is happening to our world?

This book reveals the shocking answer: We're witnessing justice and mercy severed from their source. As Christianity's influence fades, these virtues—meant to heal—have become weapons of division. We cry for justice but deliver mob rule. We preach mercy but enable evil. We demand love but can't define it.

The solution isn't another ideology. It's a return to the Author of truth, justice, and mercy—to discover what love actually IS. Not sentiment. Not tolerance. Not faith alone. But God's Perfect Love: the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant that binds truth, justice, and mercy into life-giving communion.

This isn't a theology textbook. It's a battle cry for all Catholics to start living the radical love that can save our bleeding world.

God's Perfect Love isn't just the answer. It's the only force powerful enough to heal what we've broken."
