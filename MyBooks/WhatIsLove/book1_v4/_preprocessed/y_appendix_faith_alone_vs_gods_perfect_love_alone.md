# "Faith Alone" vs "God's Perfect Love alone"

To my dear brothers and sisters in Christ—especially those who confess that we are justified by faith alone—receive this as a humble offering of gratitude and hope. We all look to the same crucified and risen Lord. We all rely upon the same grace. We all long for the same communion with the Father in the Spirit. If I argue for “God’s Perfect Love alone” as the deepest truth of the gospel, I do so not to erase “faith alone,” but to fulfill what “faith alone” most truly desires: to be bound to Jesus by the very Love that is God.

### The question in good faith

“Faith alone” insists—beautifully—that salvation is God’s work, not our boast. It is a protest against fear, performance, and spiritual bookkeeping. It magnifies Christ, exalts the sufficiency of His cross, and protects the conscience: “Whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16).

“God’s Perfect Love alone” insists that the same God who justifies by grace also indwells, heals, and transforms by grace, such that the end for which we are made is not merely acquittal, but communion: to “abide” in Christ and bear fruit (John 15), to become what we behold (2 Corinthians 3:18). It is not Love versus faith; it is Love embracing faith and bringing it to its fullness.

### What “faith alone” seeks to safeguard

- The primacy of grace: We do not climb to God. God descends to us (Ephesians 2:8–9).
- The sufficiency of Christ: His obedience, not ours, is our righteousness (Romans 5:19).
- The relief of conscience: Trust anchors us in God’s mercy, not in our fluctuating merits.

These are treasures every Christian should cherish. A humble Catholic heart can say “amen.”

### What “God’s Perfect Love alone” seeks to reveal

Scripture teaches that God is Love (1 John 4:8). Love is not merely a divine feeling; it is God’s very Being poured out in the Son and the Spirit. Because Love is first, Love is also last: “Love never ends” (1 Corinthians 13:8). And because Love is first and last, Love is also the form—the living shape—of the believer’s life now: “faith working through love” (Galatians 5:6).

To say “God’s Perfect Love alone” is to confess that:

- The source of salvation is Love: “God so loved the world…” (John 3:16).
- The way of salvation is Love: “Abide in my love… keep my commandments” (John 15:9–10).
- The end of salvation is Love: "And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love" (1 Corinthians 13:13).

Love is thus not a rival principle beside faith, but the divine life into which faith introduces us. Faith is the open hand that receives Christ; Love is Christ’s own life poured into the heart by the Spirit (Romans 5:5).

### The biblical pattern: one grace, three theological virtues

Scripture and the great Christian tradition speak of faith, hope, and love together (1 Corinthians 13:13). They are not competing ladders but a single grace unfolding:

- Faith receives Christ.
- Hope anchors us in God’s promises.
- Love unites us to God and neighbor in Christ.

James warns against a “faith” without love: “Faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead” (James 2:17). Paul warns against “works” without love: “If I give away all I have…but have not love, I gain nothing” (1 Corinthians 13:3). The apostles are not contradicting each other; they are guarding a single mystery from opposite cliffs. The heartbeat of the New Testament is that the faith that justifies is the faith that loves, because the Justifier Himself indwells the believer and loves in and through them (Galatians 2:20).

### Clarifying “works”: not wages, but communion

When the New Testament rejects “works,” it rejects the idea that God’s favor can be earned by human effort. But when it commands works of love, it calls us to participate in Christ’s own life. These “works” are not wages; they are wedding-life—signs that the Vine is alive in the branches (John 15:1–8). If Love is in us, Love acts. If Love acts in us, all the glory goes to God.

Thus, to say “God’s Perfect Love alone” is to confess that any true good we do is God’s Love moving us. Our cooperation is real, but Love is anterior, empowering, and triumphant. “It is God who works in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure” (Philippians 2:13).

### Mercy’s logic: justification and sanctification as one embrace

Viewed within Love, justification and sanctification are not rival operations but two notes of the same music: God declares the sinner righteous in Christ and simultaneously begins to make the sinner righteous by Christ. The declaration heals; the healing declares. Christ is our righteousness (1 Corinthians 1:30), and the Spirit conforms us to Him (Romans 8:29). The emphasis may differ among Christians, but the melody is one: the redeemed become like the Redeemer because His Love is not only for us but in us.

### Why language matters—and why Love is larger

Many Protestants clarify: “Faith alone justifies, but the faith that justifies is never alone.” Catholics clarify: “We are justified by grace through faith, and this faith is enlivened and formed by love” (Galatians 5:6). Both mean to deny Pelagianism, both mean to confess grace, both mean to exalt Christ.

So why speak of “God’s Perfect Love alone”? Because Scripture itself places Love as both origin and goal, form and fulfillment. Faith is indispensable—as sight is indispensable to a journey. But the destination is Love: God Himself, and union with Him. Faith is ordered to Love as seed to fruit, promise to fulfillment, engagement to marriage supper (Revelation 19:7–9). Every gift of God’s grace is, from first to last, the self-gift of the God who is Love.

### Practical convergence: one life, one witness

- In prayer: Faith trusts; Love abides. We come boldly to the throne of grace (Hebrews 4:16) and linger there because Love welcomes us.
- In moral life: Faith hears; Love obeys. “If you love me, you will keep my commandments” (John 14:15). Obedience is not a fee; it is fidelity in friendship (John 15:14–15).
- In suffering: Faith clings; Love endures. “The love of Christ controls us” (2 Corinthians 5:14), and so we endure trials, knowing that nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:39).
- In mission: Faith proclaims; Love persuades. We preach Christ crucified, and we become, by grace, living parables of His mercy (Matthew 5:14–16).

### A gentle plea

If you confess “faith alone,” keep confessing it with the breadth Scripture gives it: a living faith that works through love because Love Himself has taken up residence in your heart. And if you confess “God’s Perfect Love alone,” remember that Love Himself has ordained faith as Love’s doorway, hope as Love’s anchor, the sacraments as Love’s touch, and the Church as Love’s household.

Let us, then, not stand in rival camps shouting slogans across a valley Christ has bridged with His own Body. Instead, let us stand together under the Cross, where Love shows us what Love means: “Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends” (John 15:13). From that Cross, He gives us His Spirit, who pours God’s love into our hearts (Romans 5:5), so that the world might know we are His disciples—by our love (John 13:35).

### Final word

Faith magnifies Christ by trusting Him. Love magnifies Christ by becoming like Him. The gospel magnifies Christ by uniting us to Him. If we must choose a single banner to fly over all, let it be the one Scripture flies: “the greatest of these is love” (1 Corinthians 13:13). Not because faith is small, but because faith’s greatness is to hand us over to Love, and Love’s greatness is to hand us over to God.

May the God who is Love perfect our faith, sustain our hope, and crown us with Himself.

—In charity and gratitude, a servant of the Love that has first loved us (1 John 4:19)
