Foreword

I collected all the words and strung them together. But I cannot
claim to be the author.

I did not create the Universe. I did not create the Earth. I did not
create the first man and woman. I did not create myself, I was born of
Barry J. and Magda Steil (they didn’t create themselves either, thank
you MamaLou, DaddyBob and Abuela and Abuelo). I did not invent
the English language, nor did I teach it to myself. I did not create
the Catholic Church. I did not create the Catholic Catechism. I did
not create the Catholic Bible. I did not create the Catholic Faith. I
did not create the Saints. I came to know, love and serve Jesus from
my list of saints, most notably: - MamaLou and DaddyBob - faithful
Catholics their entire lives - parents of 11 - My Dad - who showed me
the faithfulness of a good husband and Father - Father Rutledge - who
cared so much for the younger generation - Laura and Ramon Reyes
- who followed the Holy Spirit and introduced me directly to Jesus
- Father Kane - who was a true shepherd and a true friend - John
Husum and Berta Briceno - who support our youth group so much -
Bill LaBarr - who taught me Faith begins with gratitude - Timothy
Keller who taught me what an idol actually is - My son Keaton - who
helped bring me back to the Catholic faith - My wife Tyra - who
is the most important reason for me to desire God’s love and gave
me six sons that that both helped me learn God’s love as husband
and father. - The myriad of Catholic lay authors and apologists that
taught me the beauty of the faith - Tim Staples - Trent Horn - Joe
Heschmeyer

There is not a single idea or principle that I created or came up with
for this book.

I was taught by the Church (all of those above) and God gave me a
desire to enjoy organizing facts and synthesizing them.

My prayer my whole life has been to be able to share the deep Love
that God shared with me in a way that just makes sense to people.

The author of this book is the Holy Spirit working through the
Church.

I am not claiming any semblance of “divine revelation” here. Only
that I see my entire life - and yours - as divinely inspired. As I like
to say, our entire existence is “super-natural”!

And through the Holy Spirit, I am just trying to gather all the wisdom
of our Creator into - I hope - the most meaningful book you will ever
read.

This book will help you to understand everything that the Bible and
the Church teaches about God’s love - that has been revealed to us
through the ages and that my feeble mind could put together into a
work.

This book does not stand alone. It relies heavily on and points you to
the vast wisdom of the Church and the Holy Spirit in the Bible, the
Catechism, Saints, theologians and Popes who have been teaching us
about God’s immense love for us over the ages. So look at it as a
collection of and pointer to the best of the Church’s teaching in one
place.

This book is basically putting forth what seems to me a very compre-
hensive definition of what God’s love is and how we are to live our
lives in response to it.

I call it “God’s Perfect Love”.

And why do we need this definition?

Because we live in a world where love is misused, misunderstood and
misapplied.

                                  iii
Chapter 0 Foreword


And when it is, it is not love at all. In fact, it can turn down right
evil.

Through this book we will be able to understand the true meaning of
love, sin and salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ who perfectly
embodied and lived out His Perfect Love.

It blew my mind when I rediscovered this golden nugget in the Cate-
chism of the Catholic Church that helps us understand the complete
context of all of the Church’s teachings and Sacred Scripture as well:

     “The whole concern of doctrine and its teaching must be
     directed to the love that never ends. Whether something
     is proposed for belief, for hope or for action, the love of our
     Lord must always be made accessible, so that anyone can
     see that all the works of perfect Christian virtue spring
     from love and have no other objective than to arrive at
     love.”

     — CCC 25

And to the problem of evil the Catechism tells us how to solve it!

     “If God the Father almighty, the Creator of the ordered
     and good world, cares for all his creatures, why does evil
     exist? To this question, as pressing as it is unavoidable
     and as painful as it is mysterious, no quick answer will
     suﬀice. Only Christian faith as a whole constitutes the
     answer to this question: the goodness of creation, the
     drama of sin and the patient love of God who comes to
     meet man by his covenants, the redemptive Incarnation of
     his Son, his gift of the Spirit, his gathering of the Church,
     the power of the sacraments and his call to a blessed life to
     which free creatures are invited to consent in advance, but
     from which, by a terrible mystery, they can also turn away
     in advance. There is not a single aspect of the Christian
     message that is not in part an answer to the question of
     evil.”

Wow! If the Catholic Faith cannot triumph over evil, then is it truly
“good”?

Let us begin our deep dive into God’s Perfect Love, His answer to
Evil, and the full Salvation that he offers us through the Incarnation
of his Son, the Redemption of his Blood, and the Gift of his Spirit.

assisted me in researching, writing and editing this book. This book
is all based on the Church’s teachings and the Holy Spirit’s inspira-

Why I wrote this book…
(don’t skip this section!)


I wrote this book to because I have been a Disciple of the Love of
Jesus for over 35 years and I want share what He has taught me
about THE most important question we can ask: What is Love?



Our world feels like it’s coming apart at the seams, doesn’t it? We
hear constant cries for justice, for equity, for inclusion, for a solution
to income inequality. People are desperately searching for something,
often calling it “love,” but like the 1980 Johnny Lee song says, they’re
often “looking for love in all the wrong places.” It’s a deep ache in the
heart of humanity, a longing for connection, meaning, purpose and
peace that seems increasingly elusive.



I have been walking with the Lord for over 35 years and deeply think-
ing about “God is Love” and what that means. I have observed the
seismic shifts in our culture. I’m absolutely convinced of one thing:
the chaos we see, the confusion, the division, the deep wounds both
today and throughout history, boil down to a fundamental misunder-
standing of the most important question we could ever ask:

      0.2     What is Love?

0.3     For the Love of Children: Why This
        Can’t Wait
Let me tell you why this question has become so urgent for me, and
why I believe it should be urgent for you too.

Years ago, when I was serving as a youth pastor in the Methodist
Church, I had an experience that changed everything for me. I was
working with teenagers—beautiful, energetic, hopeful young people
who were asking the deepest questions about life, love, and meaning.
But I began to notice something heartbreaking: these kids were being
fed a steady diet of counterfeits - even flat out lies!

One night at Youth Group I asked the group this piercing question.
“Can we know absolutely for sure whether something is objectively
good or bad?” Of the 15 of or so youth that were there, only one
raised their hand to say “yes”, one timidly thought “maybe” and the
rest said “no”. They told me that it was dependent on the person’s
viewpoint - of what “their truth” was.

I was SHOCKED to the core. This is not the language of the Church.
This is not language we had ever used in the three years with them in
Youth Group. I had been preaching “love” to them (a very superficial
love without any detailed definition). Keep in mind, these were good
and faithful youth who would say they loved Jesus, loved their parents,
loved each other.

But what they were telling me that what they seemed to have been
taught was relativism. They were showing me the fruits of the “mod-
ernist” worldview that very successfully taught them that “there is
no objective truth”. It is a worldview that has been so successful that
it has become the default for most people. This is the worldview they
swim in every day and it had soaked in!

That’s when I realized: We are failing our children. Not just as
individual parents or teachers, but as a Church, as a society, as a
civilization. Something had to be done.

                                   vii
Chapter 0 Why I wrote this book… (don’t skip this section!)


Probably within the next six to nine months, in combination with
all of the lies being told within the Methodist Church over human
sexuality and the lack of any objective truth surrounding it, the lies
being told by society to our young people about so-called “gender
identity”, the lies of the “Black Lives Matter” movement who claimed
to be fighting for racial justice but whose solution seemed to be more
racism than justice – I was out a crossroads.

I realized that the Methodist Church had no authority structure built
into it in order to defend “truth”. What is God’s plan for human sex-
uality? What is HIS Truth on this matter? I was hearing from both
sides who were literally using the Bible to defend “their truth” about
what the Bible said about human sexuality. No one was concerned
with “the truth”, only “what they thought was true”. I realized that
anyone who said the “Bible” was our final authority - could also twist
the Scriptures to “their truth”.

When I realized all of this, that was the day I knew I could no longer be
Methodist. I was a Methodist for 20 years and I loved the Church, but
I knew I had to find a Church that would defend “truth”. I searched
many different Christian “denominations” and found that they all
had the same problem: they had no “authority” structure built into
it in order to defend “truth”. It was all based on the interpretation
of the Bible.

But two things I knew were true.

God is Love.

And Jesus said the most important commandment was:

      Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your
      soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and
      love your neighbor as yourself. (Matthew 22:37-38)

And He said that loving God and loving your neighbor was the fulfill-
ment of the Law.

And so I knew I had to dig deeper into this Truth. As I re-discovered
the Catholic Church of my youth, I found a Church that had an
authority structure built into it in order to defend “truth”. It was

                                     viii
                 Chapter 0 Why I wrote this book… (don’t skip this section!)


based on the interpretation of the Bible, but it was also based on the
teachings of the Church BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY it looked to
the ENTIRE deposit of TRUTH in our world. In His Creation! In
the Human Heart! It used its brain to robustly use logic, reason, and
science to understand the world that God created and the Scripture.

And so now, as I have been allowing the Historic Christian Church
who traces its roots all the way back to Jesus to pour into me all of
what it has discovered and teaches about God’s love, I have to write
this book.

And so my goal is to make the teachings of God’s Love as thorough
and cohesive and accessible as possible because it is the children who
suffer the most when we fail to teach them the truth about love.

This book is for the children. For the teenagers I worked with
who will end up married and divorced with court battles over children
dominating their lives. For the women who believe the lies of “my
choice” and “my gender identity”. For the young men who are not
taught the challenge and honor of masculinity in its service to love.
For the countless “social justice warriors” who have never experienced
true justice or true mercy and are fighting for something far less than
perfect.

But here’s the thing: You can’t give what you don’t have. If
we want to teach our children about authentic love, we have to have
a basic understanding of what love is! If we want to protect them
from counterfeits, it would be most helpful if we could recognize and
articulate a specific definition. If we want to raise a generation that
can heal our broken world, we have to give them the tools to do it.
And I believe that this definition of “God’s Perfect Love” ties together
all of what the Bible teaches, all of what Jesus did in His life, death
and resurrection, all of what the Church teaches, and all of what the
saints have taught.

This is why this book matters. Not just for your own spiri-
tual growth—though that’s important—but for the children who are
counting on us to get this right. The children in your family, your
parish, your community. The children who will inherit the world we

leave behind.

They deserve adults who can answer the question “What is love?”
with clarity, conviction, and truth. They deserve to see marriages
that image God’s covenant love. They deserve to experience justice
and mercy working together in their families. They deserve to grow
up knowing that they are created in the image of God, that their lives
have infinite dignity and purpose, and that authentic love is not only
possible but is their birthright as children of God. This is a matter
of justice!

The next generation is depending on us. Let’s not fail them.

It sounds so simple, doesn’t it? Yet, getting this wrong has devas-
tating consequences for individuals, families, and entire societies as
we can see in our society. Getting it right? That changes everything.
It’s the key that unlocks the meaning of our existence and the path
to true freedom, true justice and meaning.

The shortest, most profound answer comes straight from the heart of
Divine Revelation, penned by the Apostle John:


      God is Love.
      1 John 4:8

Wow. Let’s just pause and let that sink in for a moment. God. Is.
Love. If we truly believe that, if we take that statement seriously as
Catholics, then understanding love means understanding God Himself
– not that we can know everything about His infinite, unknowable
essence, but we can know things about God from what he has revealed
to us - from fundamental truths of who we are as human beings - from
the reality we find ourselves in. This book is my humble attempt,
guided by the immense wisdom of His Church, to help us, as fellow
Catholics journeying together, grasp the incredible depth, beauty, and
transformative power packed into that three-word sentence - God is
Love.

So, what is this love that God is? How do we begin to comprehend it?
Drawing from 2,000 years of Catholic teaching, the depths of prayer,

and my own experience as a husband, father and teacher of God’s
love over the last three decades, here’s what I have perceived as the
heart of it, a definition we will explore together:




                                   xi
God’s Perfect Love

The sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant — binding truth, justice,
and mercy — — gathering us into life-giving communion —

That’s a mouthful, I know! It’s dense, and each word carries signif-
icant weight. We’ll unpack every piece of that definition – sacred,
sacrificial, covenant, justice, mercy, communion – throughout this
book. But the core idea, the essential takeaway, is this: Real love,
God’s love, the love we are all searching for, is the perfect,
inseparable unity of Truth, Justice, and Mercy.

Or even shorter: God’s Perfect Love is TRUE Justice AND TRUE
Mercy. It requires Truth. It requires Justice. It requires Mercy. All
three are like three cords of a rope. All are required to make the rope
strong and complete.

Think about it in your own life, in the relationships and situations
you navigate every day:

  • Justice without mercy? That quickly becomes harsh, cold, le-
    galistic, even cruel. It can crush the spirit rather than heal
    it.
  • Mercy without justice? That becomes enabling, permissive, sen-
    timental, and ultimately unloving because it doesn’t uphold the
    truth or call us to conversion and genuine flourishing. It papers
    over wounds instead of truly healing them.
  • Trying for either justice or mercy without grounding them firmly
    in objective Truth – the Truth revealed by God? That leads
    inevitably to confusion, chaos, and the terrible suffering we see

                                  xii
                                             Chapter 0 God’s Perfect Love


      when “good intentions,” detached from reality, pave roads we
      never intended to travel.

Only when we strive, empowered by God’s grace, to bring His truth,
His justice, and His mercy together in our minds and hearts and
actions (mind, soul and strength) can we begin to experience the kind
of love, the deep peace of acceptance, and the lasting joy our hearts
were created for. And even better, we will avoid much of the suffering
that comes from misunderstanding or misapplying these concepts.

Separating them is like trying to separate heat, light, and energy from
the sun – you end up with a distortion, something less than the real
thing.

And here is the incredible gift, the breathtaking reality of our Catholic
Faith: it doesn’t just talk about this integrated love; it gives it to us
and helps us live it! It provides the concrete means to encounter and
live this love. Through:

   • UNITY in the one Church Jesus Himself founded upon Peter.
   • COMMUNION with Christ Himself, most especially in the
     Holy Eucharist, where He gives Himself to us entirely.
   • WORSHIP in the Sacred Liturgy, the Mass, that forms and
     shapes our hearts according to His.
   • TRUTH revealed definitively in Sacred Scripture and Sacred
     Tradition, authentically interpreted by the Magisterium.
   • JUSTICE taught clearly through centuries of Catholic Social
     Teaching, guiding how we build a society that reflects God’s
     design.
   • MERCY poured out infinitely from the Cross and offered freely
     in the Sacrament of Reconciliation.
   • GRACE given abundantly through all the Sacraments, empow-
     ering us to actually live this demanding but beautiful love.

The Catholic Faith isn’t just about “following rules” or checking boxes
to “get to heaven.” or “mindless ritual”. It’s about entering into a
life-transforming, dynamic relationship with God who IS Love, right
here, right now. It’s about allowing that divine love to permeate our
being and overflow into how we think, speak, and act – how we treat

                                  xiii
Chapter 0 God’s Perfect Love


our families, our neighbors, our colleagues, and even our enemies.
It’s about becoming living proof that the Catholic Faith isn’t just a
collection of ancient beliefs, but a beautiful, true, and powerful way
to live fully alive in the 21st century. And when Catholics live out
their Faith in this way, when we truly live as the Body of Christ, we
bring true LOVE into the world and offer the only real answer to the
world’s desperate search for justice, mercy, meaning, connection, and
peace - LOVE. He doesn’t just want “equity” or “inclusion” or “racial
justice” or “income equality” or “climate justice” – he wants TRUE
Justice and TRUE Mercy – he wants TRUE LOVE for us. This may
sound esoteric, but in this book I am going to show you what love
is in a VERY CONCRETE way, and how it applies to our everyday
lives. Is it simple? No. That is why it has always been a struggle for
people to define it. It is multi-faceted, like a diamond, and it requires
us to look at it from many angles to see its full beauty. But I promise
you, once you see it, you will realize that you have always known it
deep down in your heart.

     “I am the way and the truth and the life.”

      John 14:6

He didn’t say He showed the way, or taught the truth, or gave life –
He said He IS the Way, IS the Truth, IS the Life. He is the perfect
embodiment of the integrated love we seek. My deepest prayer for
this book is that it helps all of us know Jesus more intimately in this
way. And that through us, His Body, the Church, will shine ever
brighter as the light of the world and the salt of the earth, offering
the true answer to the world’s desperate search for love.

      _(A Note on Humility: While we embark on this journey
      to explore what it means that “God is Love,” we must
      always do so with profound humility. As the Catechism
      reminds us (CCC 271), God’s very mystery infinitely sur-
      passes our limited human understanding. This book fo-
      cuses specifically on the Catholic understanding of His
      love as He has revealed it and how we, His children, are
      called to participate in that divine life, I am not presum-
      ing to fully define the infinite God Himself. I have thought

                                            Chapter 0 God’s Perfect Love


      and taught and prayed for the Jesus to give me His words.
      I sincerely pray I have done so well.


0.4     Your Roadmap for This Journey
I feel so blessed that you’re joining me on this exploration of the
most vital topic imaginable: Love. This isn’t a self-help book; it’s a
deep dive into the heart of the Christian Faith, but not to make us
feel warm and fuzzy, but rather to challenge us to join Him on His
mission FOR THE SALVATION OF THE WORLD! If you have a
heart like I do for helping explain the Faith in plain english and in
a way that makes sense to the modern world, then I hope you will
“love” this book :)

My own journey into the heart of this mystery began when I was 19,
on a Catholic retreat at the “Emmaus” retreat center in Panama. It
was there God taught me His first lesson, one I have never stopped
thinking about, rooted in the words of St. John:

      “God is love, and whoever remains in love remains in God
      and God in him.”

      1 John 4:16

“God is Love.” Wow—amazing… That one statement changed my
entire life. I knew this was deep, but I had no idea! It ignited in
me a lifelong quest, to figure out: “What does it mean that ‘God
is Love’?” I felt this truth deep within my bones, yet I knew my
understanding was incomplete. Now, decades later, through countless
hours of learning, studying, thinking, teaching, and talking – God,
through His Church and most especially watching our society suffer
(needlessly) with so much un-truth, it all helped bring it all together
for me into a clear, concise, and simple understanding of what love
truly is. And that’s what I hope to share with you in this book.

I had a simple prayer back then. Lord, help me to learn how to
explain your love in a way that doesn’t sound like a bunch of theolog-
ical jargon, or “church speak,” but rather in a way that people can
understand your love in a way that just makes sense to them.

                                  xv
Chapter 0 God’s Perfect Love


And every year since then, God has led me closer and closer. And
since my reversion to the Catholic Faith, he has given me the clarity
of being able to understand His love in a way that I can share it with
you, my brothers and sisters in Christ, in a way that is powerful and
comprehensive.

The Catholic Faith held the key because it sees and honors all of
the Truth of God including the Natural and moral law written on
our hearts. When we put this together with Bible teaching and the
Church’s teaching, we get a clear picture of what God’s love is and
how we are to live it.

There is nothing new here. This is not a new definition of love, just
a clear but deep way to explain what the Church has been teaching
for 2,000 years. Note also that this or any definition of love is a weak
attempt to put into words the infinite mystery of God’s love. But
again, here it is:

The sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant — binding truth, justice,
and mercy — — gathering us into life-giving communion —

Think of this definition as a multi-faceted diamond. Each chapter will
illuminate another facet, showing how every aspect of our faith fits
perfectly together in God’s amazing plan for His desire for Commu-
nion with US! I wrote this book to be both a plain english, starting
from the ground up, explanation of what Christianity truly calls us
to, but also a devotional that will help you grow in your relationship
with the LORD and with those you love. And more importantly, I
hope it will help you join God on His mission for the Salvation of the
World.

We’ll journey together through these chapters exploring this definition
in more detail:

0.6     How This Journey Transforms Us
This progression is carefully designed to: 1. Awaken us to the reality
of evil and our need for love (Chapters 1-2) 2. Educate us about the
essential facets of perfect love (Chapters 3-7) 3. Equip us with the
sacramental means to live this love (Chapters 8-10) 4. Protect us
from counterfeits while enriching our understanding (Chapters 11-12)
5. Send us forth to live and share God’s perfect love (Chapter 13)

Each chapter builds on the previous ones, creating a complete under-
standing of how to recognize, receive, and live authentic Catholic love
in a world desperate for the real thing.

Evil

  “We know that all creation is groaning in labor pains even
  until now.”

 — Romans 8:22

  “If God the Father almighty, the Creator of the ordered
  and good world, cares for all his creatures, why does evil
  exist? To this question, as pressing as it is unavoidable
  and as painful as it is mysterious, no quick answer will
  suﬀice. Only Christian faith as a whole constitutes the
  answer to this question: the goodness of creation, the
  drama of sin and the patient love of God who comes to
  meet man by his covenants, the redemptive Incarnation of
  his Son, his gift of the Spirit, his gathering of the Church,
  the power of the sacraments and his call to a blessed life to
  which free creatures are invited to consent in advance, but
  from which, by a terrible mystery, they can also turn away
  in advance. There is not a single aspect of the Christian
  message that is not in part an answer to the question of
  evil.”

 — Catechism of the Catholic Church 309



                               1
Chapter 1 Evil


1.1     The Urgency of Our Response
      The rampant evil in our world isn’t evidence of God’s
      absence—it’s the stark contrast that reveals where life
      without divine love inevitably leads. When society aban-
      dons God’s laws of love, the results are undeniable: bro-
      ken families, confused children, and the death of human
      dignity itself.

We live in a time of intensifying moral confusion. Children are told
they can choose their gender. Marriage is redefined to exclude chil-
dren. The innocent are killed in the womb. Divorce has become
normalized and children are pitted against the parents. Euthanasia
is becoming acceptable. Following the law is becoming optional.

Truth itself has been declared unknowable.

The rampant evil serves as a stark contrast that illuminates the
truth—showing clearly where life without God leads. When society
abandons divine laws of love, the results are undeniable: broken fam-
ilies, confused children, despair, and death. We lose the very fabric
of human dignity and the foundation that justice and mercy provide
for authentic human flourishing.

This contrast helps even skeptics see that human solutions devoid of
God don’t just fail—they actively destroy what they claim to protect.
The evil has real effects, but the rest of this book will show that God’s
love is always more powerful than evil.

Yet the moral confusion of our time is not unique. What we’re wit-
nessing today is simply the latest chapter in a much older story.


1.2     The Cry That Echoes Through His-
        tory
There’s a sound that echoes through every generation, in every cul-
ture, across every continent. It’s the sound of creation itself groaning
under the weight of something that shouldn’t be there. This sound is
the problem of evil—not just natural disasters or physical suffering,

                                   2
                                                          Chapter 1 Evil


but the moral evil that flows from human choices to reject good and
choose what is harmful, selfish, and destructive.


1.3     The Reality Children See Clearly
      Every child knows instinctively that cruelty is wrong. This
      universal moral clarity isn’t learned—it’s discovered. The
      natural law written on every human heart testifies that
      we are made for love, not evil, and this witness remains
      even when sophisticated adults try to explain it away.

Watch a five-year-old witness an act of cruelty, and you’ll see some-
thing remarkable: immediate, instinctive moral clarity. They don’t
need a philosophy course to know that hurting someone innocent is
wrong. This childlike moral clarity reflects the natural law written
on every human heart (Romans 2:15). As the Second Vatican
Council teaches, “Deep within his conscience man discovers a law
which he has not laid upon himself but which he must obey. Its
voice, ever calling him to love and to do what is good and to avoid
evil, sounds in his heart at the right moment” (Gaudium et Spes 16).


1.4     The Nature and Scope of Moral Evil
Moral evil results from free choices to reject good. St. Augustine’s
profound insight teaches us that “Evil is not a substance or a nature;
it is rather a privation or absence of good. Evil has no positive exis-
tence of its own; it exists only as a corruption or distortion of good”
(Confessions). This understanding helps us categorize the four mani-
festations of moral evil:

Personal Evil: Individual choices to disobey God—pride, lust,
greed, envy, gluttony, anger, sloth.

Relational Evil: The breakdown of covenant bonds—adultery, di-
vorce, abandonment, betrayal, exploitation.

Social Evil: Systemic injustices—slavery, traﬀicking, economic ex-
ploitation, political corruption, cultural lies that deny human dignity.

                                   3
Chapter 1 Evil


Spiritual Evil: The rejection of God Himself—atheism, relativism,
despair, idolatry.


1.5     Sin: The Root of All Evil
Sin isn’t just “making mistakes”—it’s the deliberate choice to reject
authentic love and embrace what opposes it. Evil has no positive
existence; it’s the absence or distortion of good, like darkness is the
absence of light.

This brings us to the heart of the Catholic teaching on sin—and to
the heart of why evil exists in our world. Sin is not merely “making
mistakes” or “being imperfect”—it is the deliberate choice to reject
love and embrace what is opposed to love. The Catechism of the
Catholic Church defines sin as “an offense against reason, truth, and
right conscience; it is failure in genuine love for God and neighbor
caused by a perverse attachment to certain goods” (CCC 1849).

The Pattern of Sin vs. Love

As I contemplated St. Augustine’s description that love is willing the
good of another and thinking deeply over sin and love, I discovered
these ways of describing what happens we when we choose sin over
love.

      Love is an action we take which chooses the good of others
      at our expense.

      Sin is an action that we take which chooses a perceived
      good for ourselves at the expense of others.

And note the use of “the good” vs “a perceived good”. True love
always chooses (at least our best understanding) of what is “truly
good” for the other. Sin often chooses what we perceive to be good
for ourselves, but usually it is a distorted or false understanding of
what is good for us. It violates the definition of love in some way -
usually it is not based on truth, or is not just in some way, or it is
not merciful or sacrificial in some way, etc.

This is why sin inevitably produces evil—it creates harm by prioritiz-

                                  4
                                                         Chapter 1 Evil


ing self over others—while love produces healing by choosing sacrifice
for others’ benefit.

Every evil we see in our world—every act of violence, every betrayal,
every injustice, every cruelty—can be traced back to this fundamental
reality: human hearts choosing sin over love. This is why the problem
of evil is ultimately a problem of the human heart.

Consider these concrete examples:

  • Abortion takes innocent life when people choose convenience
    over love for the vulnerable
  • Child abuse happens when someone chooses their own disor-
    dered desires over love for the innocent
  • Adultery destroys families when spouses choose selfish pleasure
    over covenant love
  • Pornography destroys the bonds of marriage (current or fu-
    ture) when spouses choose fantasy and self-pleasure over unity
    with their actual spouse (or even future spouse)
  • Divorce breaks covenant bonds when spouses choose personal
    happiness over sacrificial love
  • Gender ideology confuses children when adults choose politi-
    cal correctness over love for truth and child welfare

In every case, evil flows from a human heart that made a choice:
either love God and neighbor, seeking their authentic good, or choose
self, sin, and what appears immediately gratifying.


1.6     Sin: The Root of All Evil
      “Sin is not just a psychological weakness… It is something
      much more serious: it is a mystery of iniquity that affects
      the very heart of human existence.”

      Pope John Paul II, Reconciliatio et Paenitentia 15

What is Sin? The Catechism teaches us that “sin is an offense
against reason, truth, and right conscience; it is failure in genuine
love for God and neighbor caused by a perverse attachment to certain
goods” (CCC 1849). Every sin, whether it seems “small” or “great,”

                                   5
Chapter 1 Evil


is fundamentally a choice to reject authentic love—love of God, love
of neighbor, or proper love of self.

What is Evil? Evil, by contrast, is not a choice but the consequence
of sinful choices. As St. Augustine taught, evil is not a substance but
a privation of good—it exists only as a corruption or absence of the
good that should be there. Evil has no power on its own; it is always
the result of someone choosing to reject love.

How Sin Creates Evil: When we sin, we choose our own will
over God’s will, our own desires over the good of others, our own
immediate gratification over what is truly good for us. These sinful
choices then produce evil consequences:

   • Personal evil comes from individual sins that further wound
     our own souls
   • Relational evil comes from sins against covenant bonds that
     break families and friendships
   • Social evil comes from collective sins that become embedded
     in systems and cultures
   • Spiritual evil comes from the fundamental sin of rejecting God
     Himself

     “Original sin is the ‘reverse side’ of the Good News that
     Jesus is the Savior of all men, that all need salvation and
     that salvation is offered to all through Christ.”

      Catechism of the Catholic Church 389

Why Sin Always Produces Evil: Because we are created in the
image of God and made for love, sin is always a choice against our own
deepest nature. It promises happiness but delivers misery, promises
freedom but delivers slavery, promises life but delivers death. The
consequences of our sinful choices are devastatingly real: waves of
pain, broken relationships, and cycles of suffering that ripple outward
from every choice to reject love.

The Gravity of Our Choices: Understanding this relationship
between sin and evil helps us see why the Church takes sin so seriously.
It’s not because God is a harsh judge looking to condemn us, but
because sin literally destroys what we are made for—love, communion,

                                   6
                                                         Chapter 1 Evil


happiness, peace. Every sin, no matter how “small” it may seem,
contributes to the ocean of evil that drowns our world in suffering.

     “Sin is before all else an offense against God, a rupture
     of communion with him. At the same time it damages
     communion with the Church.”

     Catechism of the Catholic Church 1440

Every sin is a public sin, a sin against the entire Body of Christ.

What We Really Need: This comprehensive understanding reveals
the depth of our human predicament. We cannot simply “try harder”
to be good people. Sin has wounded our nature so deeply that we
need:

  • A perfect lawgiver who can show us what authentic love truly
    looks like
  • A perfect teacher who can instruct us in the way of love with-
    out error or self-interest
  • Someone who can show us the extent and fullness of God’s
    perfect truth, justice, and mercy
  • Someone who understands us completely—our struggles,
    our weaknesses, our deepest longings
  • Someone we can relate to—who has experienced what we ex-
    perience, yet without sin
  • Divine grace to heal our wounded nature and transform our
    hearts
  • Perfect love to overcome the evil that flows from our sinful
    choices

If only God had sent us someone who could be all of these things!

     God’s answer to evil isn’t a philosophy or a program—it’s
     a Person. In Jesus Christ, perfect love became incarnate:
     fully divine to reveal God’s truth, fully human to under-
     stand our struggles, and perfectly loving to transform the
     very hearts where evil begins.

The Answer: Jesus, the Christ: But this is exactly what God
did! In the Incarnation, God the Son became man—fully divine and

                                  7
Chapter 1 Evil


fully human. Jesus Christ is the perfect lawgiver (“I am the Way,
the Truth, and the Life”), the perfect teacher (“Learn from me, for I
am gentle and humble of heart”), the one who reveals the fullness of
God’s truth, justice, and mercy (“Whoever has seen me has seen the
Father”), the one who understands us completely (“He was tempted
in every way that we are, yet never sinned”), and the one we can
relate to (“The Word became flesh and dwelt among us”). Only
perfect love—God’s own love incarnate—can overcome the evil that
flows from sin by transforming the hearts where sinful choices are
made.

We will dive deeper into the love of Jesus Christ in Chapter 9.


1.7     How Love Combats Every Form of
        Evil
This book will show how each facet of authentic love—as revealed in
Jesus Christ—directly confronts specific forms of evil.

      Perfect love isn’t just one solution among many—it’s the
      comprehensive response that attacks evil at its root. Each
      facet of authentic love works together: truth conquers de-
      ception, justice overcomes oppression, mercy heals hard-
      ness of heart, sacrifice defeats selfishness, covenant pro-
      tects the vulnerable, and communion heals isolation.

Perfect love is “the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant, binding truth,
justice, and mercy, gathering us into life-giving communion,” and
each aspect of this definition becomes a weapon against evil:

Truth conquers the evil of deception and lies that keep souls in dark-
ness and prevent authentic relationships.

Justice conquers the evil of oppression and exploitation that treats
human beings as objects rather than subjects worthy of what they
are due based on their dignity as human beings created in the image
of God.

Mercy conquers the evil of hardness of heart and cycles of revenge

                                   8
                                                        Chapter 1 Evil


that perpetuate suffering and prevent healing.

Sacrifice conquers the evil of selfishness and pride—the root sins
that make us choose ourselves over God and neighbor.

Sacred Covenant conquers the evil of broken promises and dispos-
able relationships that leave children and the vulnerable without pro-
tection.

Life-giving Communion conquers the evil of isolation, loneliness,
and division that fragments human community.

Notice that these are not separate, competing solutions—they are all
facets of the one perfect love revealed in Jesus Christ. Each virtue
serves and strengthens the others, creating an integrated response
to evil that addresses both its symptoms and its source: the human
heart that chooses lesser goods over the Supreme Good.

This is why no partial solution can work. Evil is a comprehensive
problem requiring a comprehensive response. Only perfect love—
integrating all these facets—can heal what selfish sin has broken.


1.8     Why Human Solutions Fall Short
Throughout history, humanity has attempted various solutions to evil,
each failing because it cannot address the fundamental problem of the
human heart:

Political Solutions promise to legislate evil away, but they violate
perfect love by: - Rejecting the Sacred: Attempting to solve
spiritual problems through purely human power, ignoring God’s
sovereignty - Avoiding Sacrifice: Seeking power and control rather
than self-giving service - Breaking Covenant: Politicians break
promises when convenient, showing love is conditional on political
gain - Distorting Justice: Using law to serve political interests
rather than objective truth and human dignity - Lacking Mercy:
Often becoming vindictive toward political opponents rather than
seeking genuine reconciliation - Fragmenting Communion:
Dividing people into political tribes rather than building authentic
community

                                  9
Chapter 1 Evil


Educational Solutions assume knowledge conquers evil, yet they
violate perfect love by: - Denying the Sacred: Treating humans as
mere material beings who can be “fixed” through information alone
- Refusing Sacrifice: Believing we can achieve goodness without
the cost of moral transformation - Ignoring Covenant: Focusing
on individual achievement rather than relationships of fidelity and
commitment - Separating Truth from Love: Teaching facts with-
out wisdom, knowledge without virtue - Bypassing Justice and
Mercy: Assuming education eliminates the need for moral account-
ability and forgiveness - Creating Intellectual Pride: Fostering
arrogance that destroys rather than builds authentic communion

Economic Solutions claim eliminating poverty eliminates evil, yet
they violate perfect love by: - Reducing the Sacred: Treating hu-
mans as economic units rather than beings made in God’s image -
Avoiding Sacrifice: Promising prosperity without the spiritual cost
of virtue and self-discipline - Undermining Covenant: Prioritiz-
ing material transactions over permanent relationships of love - Dis-
torting Justice: Defining fairness purely in material terms rather
than what each person truly deserves as an image-bearer of God -
Replacing Mercy: Substituting government programs for personal
acts of compassion and forgiveness - Destroying Communion: Cre-
ating class warfare and envy rather than genuine community based
on shared dignity

Technological Solutions promise to engineer utopia, yet they vio-
late perfect love by: - Desacralizing Life: Treating humans as ma-
chines to be optimized rather than souls to be loved - Eliminating
Sacrifice: Seeking comfort and convenience rather than the growth
that comes through suffering and self-giving - Breaking Covenant:
Replacing permanent human relationships with temporary digital con-
nections - Obscuring Truth: Creating virtual realities that distract
from moral reality and authentic human nature - Bypassing Jus-
tice and Mercy: Using technology to avoid the hard work of moral
accountability and forgiveness - Isolating Rather Than Gather-
ing: Fragmenting human community through digital addiction and
artificial relationships

                                 10
                                                         Chapter 1 Evil


Secular Solutions attempt to eliminate God, yet they violate
perfect love most fundamentally by: - Denying the Sacred En-
tirely: Rejecting the very source and foundation of authentic love -
Making Self the Ultimate Sacrifice: Worshiping human reason
and will rather than submitting to divine love - Rejecting Divine
Covenant: Breaking the fundamental relationship that makes
all other authentic relationships possible - Relativizing Truth:
Making human opinion rather than divine revelation the measure of
reality - Corrupting Justice and Mercy: Without God as the
standard, justice becomes arbitrary power and mercy becomes mere
sentiment - Destroying True Communion: As Vatican II warns,
“Without the Creator the creature vanishes… When God is forgotten
the creature itself grows unintelligible” (Gaudium et Spes 36)

Each of these approaches fails because it violates one or more essen-
tial aspects of perfect love. They cannot address the fundamental
problem: the human heart that chooses evil over good, because they
do not understand what good actually is—the sacred, sacrificial gift
of covenant, binding truth, justice, and mercy, gathering us into life-
giving communion.

If we are to address the root cause of evil, we must attack it at its
source: the human heart. We must show people that true love, one
grounded in God and His laws of love, is the only way to a full,
abundant, true, just, merciful and meaningful life that satisfies our
deepest longings.

But in order to do that we need to understand the true nature of love,
so keep reading. We will dive into the nature of God’s Perfect Love
in the next chapter.

     The battle against evil begins where evil begins: in the
     human heart. We cannot fight the evil “out there” un-
     til we honestly confront the evil “in here.” The saints
     weren’t people who never struggled—they were people
     who learned to let God’s perfect love transform their strug-
     gles into victories.

                                  11
Chapter 1 Evil


1.9     A Personal Examination
Before we proceed to explore the facets of love, we must honestly
confront the evil in our own hearts. We cannot fight the evil “out
there” until we acknowledge the evil “in here.”

Body: How has evil affected your physical being? What habits,
addictions, or behaviors harm your body or the bodies of others?

Mind: How has evil clouded your thinking? What lies do you believe?
What truths do you resist?

Soul: How has evil damaged your relationship with God? What sins
separate you from His love? What wounds need His healing?

This isn’t meant to discourage you, but to help you recognize your
need for the perfect love that can heal all these wounds. The Saints
weren’t people who never struggled with evil—they were people who
learned to let God’s love transform their struggles into victories.

As we see in the story of Cain and Abel (Genesis 4:1-16), evil entered
the world through human choice very early in history. Cain’s jealousy
and anger led to the first murder, showing us that evil flows from
disordered desires in the human heart. St. James reminds us: “Where
do the wars and where do the conflicts among you come from? Is it
not from your passions that make war within your members?” (James
4:1).

The Catechism teaches us that each human being has the ability to
choose between good and evil.

      “God created man a rational being, conferring on him the
      dignity of a person who can initiate and control his own
      actions.”God willed that man should be ‘left in the hand of
      his own counsel,’ so that he might of his own accord seek
      his Creator and freely attain his full and blessed perfection
      by cleaving to him.”

This gift of free will makes us capable of great good, but also capable
of choosing evil. As the Catechism further explains:

      “Sin is an offense against reason, truth, and right con-

                                   12
                                                           Chapter 1 Evil


      science; it is failure in genuine love for God and neighbor
      caused by a perverse attachment to certain goods” (CCC
      1849).

This is the crucial insight: Evil is not some external force that
attacks us from outside. Evil originates in the human heart when
we choose our own will over God’s will, our own desires over the
good of others, our own immediate gratification over what is truly
good. Every act of moral evil—from the “smallest” lie to the greatest
atrocity—begins with a choice made in a human heart to reject God’s
love and embrace selfishness.

This means that if we want to fight evil effectively, we cannot simply
address external symptoms. We must address the source: the human
heart that chooses evil over good, self over others, pride over humility,
hatred over love.

     “Evil has no positive nature; but the loss of good has re-
     ceived the name ‘evil.’ ”

      St. Augustine, City of God, Book XI, Chapter 9

To fight against evil, we must repent (turn our hearts back to God)
and allow Him to fill our hearts with His Perfect Love, which then
enables us to respond with faith, hope, and charity. This will be our
topic for Chapter 2 and the rest of this book.



1.10 The Dual Purpose of This Journey
This book serves two essential purposes that work together:

First, Personal Transformation: You will learn to recognize the
evil in your own heart—not to condemn yourself, but to turn toward
God’s perfect love. Every sin is ultimately a choice of a lesser good
over the highest good. When we choose pleasure over purity, conve-
nience over life, lies over truth, or self over God, we’re not choosing
something wholly evil—we’re choosing something less than what we’re
made for. This recognition leads to true repentance: turning away
from lesser goods and toward the Supreme Good who is God Himself.

                                   13
Chapter 1 Evil


In fact we have shown that evil has no power other than what we give
it by choosing to reject God’s perfect love.

Second, Charitable and Natural Evangelization: As you expe-
rience this transformation, you’ll learn how to share these truths with
others—both victims and perpetrators of evil. This book equips you
to:

   • Show the emptiness of lesser goods: Help others see how
     their pursuits—whether money, pleasure, power, or even dis-
     torted forms of love—can never satisfy the infinite longing of
     the human heart
   • Present the fullness of the Church’s teaching: Not as a
     list of rules, but as a comprehensive vision of human flourishing
     rooted in divine love
   • Guide others to repentance: Not through condemnation,
     but by revealing the beauty of what they’re missing when they
     settle for lesser goods
   • Model authentic dialogue: Demonstrate how to discuss dif-
     ficult moral issues with both truth and compassion

When someone is trapped in sin—whether as victim or perpetrator—
they need more than judgment or sympathy. They need someone who
can show them that their deepest desires are good but misdirected.
The adulterer seeks love but in the wrong place. The thief seeks
security but through the wrong means. The liar seeks acceptance
but through deception. The gender confused teen seeks identity and
acceptance but at the sake of truth and their own dignity. Each is
pursuing a real good but in a disordered way that ultimately can
never satisfy what they seek.

Your own journey of recognizing and turning from evil in your heart
becomes the foundation for helping others do the same. As you learn
to articulate why you’ve chosen God’s love over lesser goods, you be-
come equipped to invite others into that same transformative choice.

This is the Church’s method: first, personal holiness; then, evange-
lization through witness and word. You cannot give what you do
not have. But as you receive God’s perfect love and let it transform

                                  14
                                                           Chapter 1 Evil


you, you become a living witness to its power—and a guide for others
seeking the same transformation.


1.11 Living the Response
As we continue this journey together, remember that every chapter,
every virtue, every practice we explore is part of the complete response
to evil. You’re not just learning about love—you’re being equipped
to live out your faith and make God’s love tangible in a world that
desperately needs it.

The transformation begins where evil begins: in the human heart.
The saints understood this truth. They first let God’s perfect love
transform the evil within themselves. They discovered that perfect
love really is the answer—not just in theory, but in practice.

Now it’s our turn. The world groans, but love stands ready to respond.
And that love wants to work through you—starting with your own
heart, then flowing out to transform the world.

Lord Jesus, You are perfect love incarnate. You faced the full reality of
evil on the cross and conquered it through Your death and resurrection.
Help us to see clearly the evil in our world and in our own hearts, not
to despair, but to turn to You with confidence. Transform us into
agents of Your perfect love. Give us the courage to confront evil
wherever we find it, and the wisdom to respond with the integration
of justice and mercy that You have shown us. We ask this through
Your most holy name. Amen.

Examen:

Begin each day this week with an honest examination of conscience,
asking the Holy Spirit to reveal areas where evil has taken root in your
heart. As you do this, also notice one specific example of moral evil
in the world around you (in news, relationships, society). Connect
these two observations: How does the evil you see “out there” relate
to similar tendencies in your own heart?

Reflect on these questions: - What forms of evil in our world most
deeply disturb you? How might perfect love address these specific

                                   15
Chapter 1 Evil


evils? - How has evil affected your own body, mind, and soul? What
healing do you need from God’s perfect love? - Which human solu-
tions to evil have you been most tempted to rely on instead of turning
to God’s love? - How can you begin to see yourself as an agent of
God’s perfect love in response to the evil around you?

Instead of becoming discouraged by what you discover, offer a prayer
for those affected by the evils you’ve identified—including yourself.
Ask God to show you how His perfect love might work through your
transformed heart to address both your personal struggles and the
larger evils you’ve recognized.

Remember: the same type of evil that manifests as major social prob-
lems often begins as subtle temptations in our own hearts. Your per-
sonal transformation through God’s love becomes part of His answer
to the world’s suffering.

Close each examination by praying the Act of Contrition:

O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee, and I detest
all my sins because I dread the loss of Heaven and the pains of Hell;
but most of all because they offend Thee, my God, Who art all-good
and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy
grace, to confess my sins, to do penance, and to amend my life. Amen.

At the close of each chapter, we will provide resources for those who
want to dive deeper into what our Catholic faith teaches about the
topic we’ve explored. These references—from Scripture, the Cate-
chism, and the lives of the saints—offer you the opportunity to study
more thoroughly the Church’s wisdom on these matters. Whether
you’re seeking to strengthen your own understanding or preparing to
share these truths with others, these resources will guide you to the
authoritative sources of our faith.

God’s Perfect Love

  “We have come to know and to believe in the love God has
  for us. God is love, and whoever remains in love remains in
  God and God in him. In this is love brought to perfection
  among us, that we have confidence on the day of judgment
  because as he is, so are we in this world. There is no fear in
  love, but perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do
  with punishment, and so one who fears is not yet perfect in
  love. We love because he first loved us. If anyone says, “I
  love God,” but hates his brother, he is a liar; for whoever
  does not love a brother whom he has seen cannot love God
  whom he has not seen. This is the commandment we have
  from him: whoever loves God must also love his brother.”

  1 John 4:16-21

  “If I have all faith so as to remove mountains but do not
  have love, I am nothing.”

  1 Corinthians 13:2

  “Man cannot live without love. He remains a being that
  is incomprehensible for himself, his life is senseless, if love
  is not revealed to him, if he does not encounter love, if he
  does not experience it and make it his own, if he does not

                                18
                                             Chapter 2 God’s Perfect Love


      participate intimately in it.”

      Pope St. John Paul II, Redemptor Hominis 10

      “The whole concern of doctrine and its teaching must be
      directed to the love that never ends. Whether something is
      proposed for belief, for hope, or for action, the love of our
      Lord must always be made accessible, so that anyone can
      see that all the works of perfect Christian virtue spring
      from love and have no other objective than to arrive at
      love.”

      Catechism of the Catholic Church 25

      “If God the Father almighty, the Creator of the ordered
      and good world, cares for all his creatures, why does evil
      exist? To this question, as pressing as it is unavoidable
      and as painful as it is mysterious, no quick answer will
      suﬀice. Only Christian faith as a whole constitutes the
      answer to this question: the goodness of creation, the
      drama of sin and the patient love of God who comes to
      meet man by his covenants, the redemptive Incarnation of
      his Son, his gift of the Spirit, his gathering of the Church,
      the power of the sacraments and his call to a blessed life to
      which free creatures are invited to consent in advance, but
      from which, by a terrible mystery, they can also turn away
      in advance. There is not a single aspect of the Christian
      message that is not in part an answer to the question of
      evil.”

      Catechism of the Catholic Church 309




2.1     The Question That Changes Every-
        thing
In Chapter 1, we saw that evil originates in the human heart when
we choose against love, and that perfect love is the complete answer

                                   19
Chapter 2 God’s Perfect Love


to the problem of evil. But this raises the most crucial question of
our time: if love is the answer to evil, what exactly is love and how
can we live out “perfect love”?

This question becomes urgent when we look around at the teenagers
and young adults in our culture today. These beautiful young people
carry a hunger so deep it’s almost visible—they’re desperate for love
that is authentic, lasting, and transformative. But everywhere they
turn, our society is feeding them counterfeits that flow from the dis-
ordered hearts of adults who have themselves accepted lesser goods.

Our culture teaches young women that they must give their bodies
away to be loved, that their worth is measured by their sexual de-
sirability. Young men are told that commitment is optional, that
“real men” avoid emotional vulnerability, and that conquest is more
valuable than covenant. Children from broken homes often conclude
(subconsciously by the ‘tradition’ of their own parents) that marriage
is only for a time and that promises are made to be broken. Mean-
while, social media and entertainment bombard them with messages
that reduce love to feelings, pleasure, or personal fulfillment. They
are told that the most important values in life are to ‘be happy’ or
‘follow your heart’ or to ‘live your dreams’ or to ‘pursue your passions’
or to ‘pursue career and financial success’.

These cultural counterfeits don’t emerge from nowhere—they flow
from individual hearts that have chosen to worship lesser goods in-
stead of the Supreme Good. When adults choose career over family,
pleasure over purity, convenience over life, or self over service, they
create a culture that teaches these same disordered priorities to the
next generation.

They are all hungry for authentic love, but our society has stripped
them of any vocabulary for the real thing. This is the tragedy of our
time: a generation starving for love while being fed poison by men,
women, parents, teachers, politicians and even religious leaders who
have forgotten what love truly means.

This is the universal cry for love—the deepest longing of every human
heart. And if we can’t answer the question “What is love?” clearly

                                   20
                                            Chapter 2 God’s Perfect Love


and completely and live that out in our lives, we’re failing the next
generation just when they need us most.

      Every human heart carries the same hunger—not for coun-
      terfeits, but for the authentic love that only God can give.
      This isn’t learned behavior; it’s written into our very na-
      ture as beings made in the image of Love Himself.

We also hear cries in our society today for justice and mercy, which
we will address in subsequent chapters, but if we don’t understand
love correctly, we will be unequipped to help them find true justice
and mercy—or to identify the counterfeit loves that keep our society
in bondage to sin and deeper injustice.



2.2     The Universal Experience of Longing
The cry for love isn’t just a preference or a nice-to-have. It’s writ-
ten into the very fabric of our being—body, mind, and soul. This
longing engages our entire nature, revealing that we are created for
relationship at every level.

The Body’s Cry for Love: Our bodies are designed for relationship.
From the moment we’re born, we need physical touch, comfort, and
presence. Watch an infant reach for their mother’s face, or observe
how a child runs into their parent’s arms after a nightmare. Our
bodies literally recoil from isolation and thrive in loving presence.
We’re created for embrace, for gentle touch, for the physical comfort
that says “you are not alone.” And of course our bodies are created
for intimate embrace within the marital covenant for the gift of new
life and: “That is why a man leaves his father and mother and clings
to his wife, and the two of them become one body.” (Genesis 2:24)

The Mind’s Cry for Love: Our intellects hunger to be known and
understood. We long for someone to “get” us—to see our thoughts,
dreams, and ideas as valuable and worthy of attention. There’s a
special joy that comes when someone truly understands what we’re
trying to communicate, when they see the world through our eyes and
appreciate the unique way we think and process reality. As St. Paul

                                  21
Chapter 2 God’s Perfect Love


beautifully expresses this longing: “At present I know partially; then
I shall know fully, as I am fully known” (1 Corinthians 13:12).

The Soul’s Cry for Love: At the deepest level, our souls hunger for
unconditional acceptance and eternal commitment. The soul knows
instinctively that human love, however beautiful, points beyond itself
to something perfect and permanent. We see the depth of this soul-
love most clearly in our grief—the profound sorrow we feel when we
lose someone we love reveals just how deeply love is written into our
very being. Even Jesus wept at the death of His friend Lazarus (John
11:35), showing us that grief is love’s testimony to the preciousness
of the beloved. The deepest cry of the soul is for the love that will
never end, never disappoint, and never fail—the love that can only
come from God Himself.

      Authentic love engages our entire being—body, mind, and
      soul—because we are created as integrated persons, not
      fragmented parts. When any dimension is neglected, love
      becomes distorted and ultimately fails to satisfy.

When these three dimensions work in harmony, we are able and desire
to seek authentic love that honors the whole person. When they’re
disordered, we either become purely physical (using bodies without
engaging hearts), coldly intellectual (analyzing love without experi-
encing it), or unrealistically spiritual (expecting perfection from im-
perfect human beings).

This integration of love within our heart, mind, and soul is not
accidental—it flows from the very nature of our being. This is pre-
cisely why Jesus, when asked about eternal life, points the scholar of
the law back to love as the means to eternal communion with God.
“Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” Jesus said to him,
“What is written in the law? How do you read it?” He said in reply,
“You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your
being, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neigh-
bor as yourself. He replied to him,”You have answered correctly; do
this and you will live.” (Luke 10:25-28)

                                  22

2.3      Why This Longing is Universal: Made
         in the Image of God
This universal longing for love isn’t taught or merely cultural—it’s
written into our very nature because we are made in the image of
God. As Scripture reveals in the very first chapter of Genesis: “So
God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created
them; male and female he created them” (Genesis 1:27).

      Being made in God’s image means we share certain qual-
      ities that make us fundamentally different from all other
      creatures. We can know truth, choose freely, create waves
      of good or evil, love sacrificially, long for the infinite, and
      are called to communion.

The Second Vatican Council beautifully explains what this means:
“Man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for it-
self, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself”
(Gaudium et Spes 24). We are the only creatures that were not made
 for some useful “end”—yet paradoxically, we achieve our greatest dig-
 nity when we are willing to give away what and who we are for the
 good of others, following Christ’s example.

      “If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself
      and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever wants
      to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for
      my sake will find it.”

      Jesus Christ (Matthew 16:24-25)

Pope John Paul II, in his Theology of the Body, taught that being
made in God’s image means we are created with the capacity for love
and called to love. As he explained, “Man cannot live without love.
He remains a being that is incomprehensible for himself, his life is
senseless, if love is not revealed to him, if he does not encounter love,
if he does not experience it and make it his own” (Redemptor Hominis
10).

What Makes Us Different

                                    23
Chapter 2 God’s Perfect Love


Being made in God’s image means we share certain qualities that
make us fundamentally different from all other creatures:

   • We can know truth (intellect) about reality, goodness, and
     God—not just respond to stimuli
   • We can choose freely (will) between good and evil—we’re
     not driven by instinct alone but called to choose the good
   • We can create waves of good or evil (intellect and will
     together)—our choices to love or sin ripple outward, affecting
     countless others
   • We can love sacrificially (soul)—putting another’s good
     above our own immediate desires
   • We long for the infinite (soul)—no finite good can fully
     satisfy us
   • We are called to communion (body, mind, and soul)—
     designed for relationship with God and others

These are the heart, mind and soul all working together to know,
choose, and love.

This is why the cry for love is universal. Every human heart knows
instinctively that we’re made for something more than mere survival
or pleasure. We’re made for love because we’re made in the image of
Love Himself.

      The universal hunger for love isn’t learned behavior—it’s
      the echo of our divine origin. We are the only creatures
      created for relationship with God himself, and this ex-
      plains why no earthly love, however beautiful, can fully
      satisfy our infinite longing.


2.4     What Children Know About Love
Before we examine how great minds have tried to define love, let’s
look at an unexpected source of wisdom—our children. Watch how
children naturally understand love before the world teaches them oth-
erwise:

Love is Sacred. When parents divorce, children don’t just feel sad—

                                 24
                                           Chapter 2 God’s Perfect Love


they feel like something holy has been broken. They instinctively
know love deserves reverence, not casual treatment.

Love is Sacrificial. A child giving their last piece of candy to com-
fort a crying sibling isn’t taught to do this—they’re expressing what
they know love requires.

Love Creates Covenant. Children are devastated by divorce be-
cause they understand “I love you” means forever. They can’t com-
prehend why adults treat love as temporary or conditional.

Love Requires Truth. A child discovering their parent lied feels
betrayed at the core. They know love and deception cannot coexist.

Love Demands Justice. Children become furious at bullying be-
cause they know love means protecting the vulnerable. “That’s not
fair!” reveals their understanding that love requires standing up for
what’s right.

Love Shows Mercy. When children break something precious, they
cry out for mercy with genuine anguish, knowing they need forgive-
ness to restore the relationship.

This childlike understanding isn’t naive—it’s profound. Jesus said,
“Unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the
kingdom of heaven” (Matthew 18:3). Children see love clearly because
authentic love is written on the human heart as natural law.

      Children understand love perfectly before the world
      teaches them otherwise. Their instinctive knowledge of
      love’s sacredness, sacrifice, and permanence reveals what
      our hearts truly seek—and what we lose when we settle
      for counterfeits.


2.5     Traditional Definitions                    and       Their
        Contributions
Throughout history, great minds and holy saints have offered pro-
found insights into the nature of love, each contributing essential
pieces to our understanding.

                                 25
Chapter 2 God’s Perfect Love


Classical Philosophy provided foundational categories that remain
invaluable. Aristotle’s distinction between eros (romantic love), philia
(friendship), and storge (familial affection) helps us recognize love’s
different expressions. Plato’s vision of love as the soul’s journey from
physical beauty to spiritual truth reveals love’s transformative power.
The Stoics’ emphasis on love as rational benevolence shows us love’s
connection to virtue and duty.

Christian Tradition brought revolutionary depth through the
saints and doctors of the Church. St. Augustine’s teaching that
love is the ordering principle of all virtue—“Love God, and do what
you will”—reveals love as the foundation of moral life. St. Thomas
Aquinas’s definition of love as “willing the good of another” empha-
sizes love as an act of the will directed toward another’s benefit.
St. John of the Cross explored love as mystical union with God
through purification and surrender.

Modern Insights have added valuable psychological and social un-
derstanding. Romantic love’s emphasis on emotional attraction shows
us love’s affective power. Humanitarian love’s stress on universal com-
passion reveals love’s social dimension. Psychological insights about
healthy attachment help us understand love’s developmental aspects.

Yet while each tradition offers valuable insights, none provides the
complete picture that our hearts truly seek and that our world des-
perately needs.


2.6     Why Love Is the Complete Answer to
        Evil
As we saw in Chapter 1, sin chooses our own good at the expense of
others, while love chooses others’ good at our own expense. This is
why love is the complete answer to evil: it reverses sin’s fundamental
pattern. Where sin creates harm through selfishness, love creates
healing through sacrifice. We will explore this sacrificial heart of love
in depth in Chapter 6.

When we choose to do what is true, just, merciful - it creates

                                   26
                                            Chapter 2 God’s Perfect Love


waves of “good” in the world. When we choose to do what is
false, unjust, cruel - it creates waves of “evil” in the world.


2.7     God’s Perfect Love
Through careful study of Scripture and the Church’s teaching on love,
we can see that perfect love cannot be reduced to a single dimension.
It must integrate all the essential elements that Scripture and the
Church reveal about love’s nature. Here is the definition that will
guide our entire journey:

      The sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant — binding truth,
      justice, and mercy — gathering us into life-giving commu-
      nion

Let’s understand what “perfect” means here. Perfect doesn’t mean
flawless performance or earning God’s love through our efforts.
Rather, perfect means complete and integrated—love that includes
all its essential facets working in harmony. Jesus calls us to this
perfection: “Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect”
(Matthew 5:48). This is possible not through human effort alone,
but through grace (His Perfect Love) that teaches and transforms us.
Obviously Jesus is not going to give us a command that we cannot
follow.

Rather, to be “perfect” in our love for God and neighbor, we need to
understand all the facets of what love is.

Every word matters:

Sacred: God is Love. Love participates in the divine nature and
reflects God’s own love. Because every human person is created in
God’s image, love is never merely human emotion but a participation
in the very life of God. When we love another person, we’re honoring
the divine image within them and expressing our own divine calling.
We must go to the source of love to find it, know it and live it.

Sacrificial: Love is ordered toward the true, just and merciful good
of the other. It’s not mere sentiment but proven through action that
puts another’s wellbeing before our own preferences. As Jesus taught,

                                  27
Chapter 2 God’s Perfect Love


“No one has greater love than this, to lay down one’s life for one’s
friends” (John 15:13). Love runs into the burning building, stays up
all night with a sick child, forgives even the unrepentant, and puts
the needs of others before our own.

Gift: Love is freely given, not earned or demanded. It cannot be
bought, manipulated, or coerced. Love that must be earned isn’t
love at all—it’s a transaction. Love is always voluntarily given and
received.

Covenant: Love creates permanent, binding relationships that en-
dure through diﬀiculties. It operates at multiple levels—binding us
first to God, then flowing into faithful family bonds, and extending
to create just society ordered toward the common good. Love binds
us together.

Truth: Love cannot exist without truth. Jesus declares, “I am the
way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6). Authentic love requires
knowing the truth about God, ourselves, and each person’s inherent
dignity as made in God’s image. We cannot truly love someone we
are deceiving or whose true worth we deny. Truth liberates us to love
properly and conforms itself to reality rather than our preferences.

Justice: Love gives to our Creator and each person what they are due
based on the truth and dignity as image-bearers of God. It provides
objective standards and prevents love from becoming mere sentiment.
Love is 100% just.

and: - the and binds truth, justice and mercy together. All three are
required!

Mercy: Love goes beyond what is due, offering forgiveness and sec-
ond chances. It provides compassion when justice alone would crush.
Love is 100% merciful.

gathering us into: God’s love gathers us into His Kingdom. We
are called to be His Kingdom on earth, servants of His love to fight
against evil and build up the Kingdom of God.

Life-giving Communion: Love creates authentic relationship and
community and life. It builds up rather than tears down, unites

                                 28
                                              Chapter 2 God’s Perfect Love


rather than divides, and generates new life and hope. Love is 100%
life-giving.

When all these elements are present together, love becomes perfect—
capable of conquering all forms of evil and creating authentic commu-
nion between persons. This is what children instinctively understand,
what the saints lived, and what Jesus demonstrated perfectly on the
cross.

      Perfect love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant, bind-
      ing truth, justice, and mercy, gathering us into life-giving
      communion.

This isn’t just a definition—it’s the complete answer to the problem
of evil itself.

You can see from these facets of love that people understand bits
and pieces of this and live these things out imperfectly. This is why
we struggle to define and understand love—without God’s Perfect
Love as our guide, we can only see distorted fragments of what our
hearts truly seek. Look around and you’ll see people everywhere
desperately pursuing the sacred (through spirituality), the sacrificial
(through causes), the covenantal (through marriage and family), truth
(through science and philosophy), justice (through politics), mercy
(through humanitarian work), and communion (through community).
But without the complete vision that God provides, these pursuits
become twisted counterfeits that ultimately disappoint and when they
don’t adhere to some facet of God’s Perfect Love, they can lead to
great harm and evil.


2.8     God’s Perfect Love leads to True Free-
        dom
But here’s the problem we all face. As we saw in Chapter 1, something
has gone wrong with our ability to love. We know what love should
look like, but we struggle to live it. We want to be loving people,
but we find ourselves being selfish, petty, or hurtful instead. We long
for deep, authentic relationships, but we keep settling for shallow

                                    29
Chapter 2 God’s Perfect Love


connections or getting trapped in toxic patterns.

Jesus put His finger on the real issue when the Jews claimed they
had never been enslaved to anyone and questioned how they could
become free. “We are descendants of Abraham and have never been
enslaved to anyone. How can you say, ‘You will become free’?” Jesus
answered them, “Amen, amen, I say to you, everyone who commits
sin is a slave of sin” (John 8:33-34).

Jesus reveals the deeper problem: our hearts have become enslaved
to what Scripture calls idols—things that can be good in themselves,
but become evil when we worship them (give them our ’worth’ship)
instead of God. We think we’re free, but we’re actually trapped by
our disordered loves.

The Slavery of Idolatry

An idol is any finite created good that we treat as if it can be our
ultimate source of meaning, value and purpose. We give it our
‘worth’ship’ instead of giving credit, honor and worship to God our
Creator. When we make an idol of something, we become enslaved
to it, and our ability to love authentically becomes corrupted:

   • Money and Career: When we worship financial security or
     professional success, we sacrifice relationships and moral princi-
     ples for advancement. Love becomes transactional—we “love”
     people for what they can do for our careers. We put our “faith”
     in financial success and make that our priority rather than giv-
     ing justice to God or family.

   • Romantic Relationships: When we make our spouse or ro-
     mantic partner our ultimate source of happiness, we place im-
     possible burdens on them and become possessive, jealous, or
     manipulative. Love becomes stifling rather than giving. We be-
     come willing to do anything to keep our partner happy, even if
     it means sacrificing their dignity or well-being.

   • Family and Children: When we make our children our ul-
     timate purpose, we can become overprotective, controlling, or
     living vicariously through them. Love becomes suffocating or
     destructive rather than liberating. We end up demanding love

                                  30
                                           Chapter 2 God’s Perfect Love


      from our children which violates the free gift of love and then
      it destroys us when they don’t give their love to us.

   • Pleasure and Comfort: When we worship immediate gratifi-
     cation, we become incapable of the sacrifice that authentic love
     requires. Love becomes selfish rather than self-giving. Love be-
     comes caved in on our own selves which damages our ability and
     desire to direct out love outward.

   • Power and Control: When we worship our own will being
     done, we become incapable of the submission and service that
     love requires. Love becomes domination rather than covenant.
     Love is demanded to be done our way and not for the benefit
     of the other. Taken to its logical conclusion, we end up being
     tyrants.

And when our idols inevitably fail us—when we lose our job, when a
spouse leaves, when a child dies—our lives collapse into devastation.
Our very sense of value and meaning is shattered because we were
depending on these created goods to provide what only God himself
can give.

This is exactly why Jesus came—not just to teach us about love, but
to break the chains that keep us from living it. As Bishop Barron
often explains, using an analogy that traces back to St. John Henry
Newman’s insights, the Church’s moral teachings are like the banks
of a river. Without banks, water cannot become a powerful, life-
giving river—it becomes a placid lake or a destructive flood or a
stagnant swamp. The banks don’t restrict the river’s power; they
give it direction, purpose, and the ability to reach its destination.

Similarly, when the Church teaches about marriage, family, sexuality,
or relationships, it’s not trying to control us—it’s showing us the
“banks” God has given us that allow love to flow with power and
purpose rather than dissipating into chaos. Without this kind of
guidance, our cry for love becomes like being hungry but not knowing
which foods will nourish us and which will poison us.

The Church as a whole becomes the banks of the river of Chrit’s love
for us. Teaching us, sanctifying us, and pouring out His love to us

                                 31
Chapter 2 God’s Perfect Love


through the sacraments making His love powerful and life-giving to
the entire world.

      True freedom isn’t found in rejecting all boundaries—it’s
      discovered when we bind ourselves to Christ’s perfect love.
      The Church’s teachings aren’t chains but the banks that
      allow love’s river to flow with power, purpose, and life-
      giving direction.

The paradox is that freedom is not the absence of boundaries but the
ability to direct the power of love with purpose and direction within
the bounds of truth, justice, and mercy. We must bind ourselves to
Christ who is our perfect example and teacher of love.

This is true freedom. Jesus said “I am the way, the truth, and the
life.” (John 14:6) and “You will know the truth, and the truth will
set you free.” (John 8:32).



2.9     The Foundation for the Entire Book
In these first two chapters, we have laid a crucial foundation: the
fundamental problem facing humanity is the evil in man’s heart, and
filling the heart with love is the answer to that problem. We’ve seen
that this isn’t just theological theory but corresponds to the deepest
cry of every human heart and the natural understanding that even
children possess.

Our comprehensive definition—perfect love as “the sacred, sacrificial
gift of covenant, binding truth, justice, and mercy, gathering us into
life-giving communion”—now serves as our roadmap for the entire
journey ahead. Chapters 3 through 7 will unpack each aspect of
this definition, showing in detail how each facet of God’s perfect love
directly combats specific forms of evil in our hearts and in the world.
In Chapters 8 through 12, we will explore how the Church that Jesus
started pours out His love to us through the sacraments and the
teachings of the Church about His love. In chapter 13, we will see
how the Gospel is God’s perfect love and how we can participate in
it through the Church.

                                  32
                                            Chapter 2 God’s Perfect Love


At every step, we will see how God’s perfect love—integrating all these
elements—is not just a beautiful ideal but the practical, powerful
answer to the sin in our hearts that creates evil in the world. Through
the Catholic Faith, we have access to the fullness of this love, and
through living it authentically, we become witnesses to the world of
God’s perfect love.

God’s perfect love stands against all forms of evil and counterfeit
love. It opposes mere sentiment by including objective standards of
justice, harsh legalism by offering merciful forgiveness, individualism
by emphasizing covenant relationships and communion, utilitarianism
by recognizing the sacred dignity of each person made in God’s image,
relativism by grounding love in the objective reality of human dignity,
and temporality by establishing permanent covenant bonds. We will
explore these counterfeits and how God’s perfect love defeats them in
much greater detail in chapter 11.

Our exploration of God’s perfect love begins by addressing the most
immediate and universal reaction to its absence: the cry for justice.
This cry, as we shall see in chapter 3, reveals the foundational struc-
ture that love requires to be true and lasting, and why it is an indis-
pensable part of the perfect love that answers the problem of evil.


2.10 Living the Response
Understanding what love truly is changes everything. It means we
can resist counterfeits—either in our own hearts or in the culture
around us. It means we have a standard by which to measure every
relationship, every choice, every commitment. Most importantly, it
means we can be liberated from the slavery of idolatry that corrupts
our ability to love.

The saints understood this liberation. St. Thérèse of Lisieux called
love “the vocation which includes all others.” St. John the Apostle
spent his final years proclaiming the simple truth: “God is love.”
St. Augustine built his entire theology on the foundation that love is
the ordering principle of all virtue. But they also understood that
sin and idolatry enslave us and prevent us from loving—which is why

                                  33
Chapter 2 God’s Perfect Love


they embraced the Church’s teachings not as burdens, but as the very
tools of their liberation.

These saints didn’t just understand love intellectually—they lived it.
They allowed God’s perfect love to transform their hearts and liberate
them from the slavery of idolatry, and through them, it transformed
the world. This is our calling also: to understand love so deeply
that it transforms us from the inside out, freeing us to become instru-
ments of God’s love in a world desperately hungry for both truth and
liberation.

This is why the Church and our Lord himself calls all Catholics to
become Saints. Saints don’t just avoid sin, they live the love of God
in their hearts and transform the world around them.

      “Whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself, take
      up his cross, and follow me. For whoever wishes to save
      his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake
      will find it.”

      Matthew 16:24-25

Heavenly Father, You are Love itself, and You have written the cry
for love in every human heart. We confess that sin and idolatry have
enslaved us and corrupted our ability to love authentically. Liberate
us through the truth of Your Son, Jesus Christ, who came to set the
captives free. Help us to understand what love truly means—not the
counterfeits the world offers, but the perfect love that flows from Your
own divine nature. Break the chains of idolatry that prevent us from
loving as we should, and give us the grace to live this love authentically,
so that through us, others may encounter both the truth that liberates
and the love they’re truly seeking. Through Christ our Lord, who is
Love incarnate and our Liberator. Amen.


2.11      Examen: Recognizing the Cry for
          Love
Reflection Questions: 1. Where do I see the pure understanding
of love that children possess, and how can I return to that clarity?

                                    34
                                            Chapter 2 God’s Perfect Love


2. How do I see the cry for love manifesting in my own life—in my
body, mind, and soul? 3. What idols have I been tempted to worship
instead of God, and how have they corrupted my ability to love? 4.
How does understanding love as “sacred, sacrificial, covenantal, just,
merciful, and life-giving” help me understand the joys and sorrows of
my relationships? 5. How has idolatry enslaved my ability to love,
and where do I need Christ’s liberation most?

Daily Practice: Each day this week, when you encounter someone
(family member, coworker, stranger), try to recognize the cry for love
in their words and actions. Ask yourself: “What is this person’s heart
truly longing for? Is it justice, mercy, truth, covenant, sacrifice, or
something else?” Then consider: “How can I respond with authentic
love rather than a counterfeit?” Remember that your own liberation
from idolatry enables you to help liberate others.

Act of Contrition: My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my
heart. In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good, I have sinned
against You whom I should love above all things. I firmly intend, with
Your grace, to do penance, to sin no more, and to avoid whatever
leads me to sin. Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us. In
His name, my God, have mercy. Amen.

Understanding the universal cry for love is the first step toward be-
coming the kind of person who can satisfy that hunger in others.
In the next chapter, we’ll explore another universal cry that echoes
through every human heart: the cry for justice. Together, these fun-
damental longings reveal the complete picture of what authentic love
must include.

Justice

      “Learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; bring
      justice to the fatherless, plead the widow’s cause.”

      Isaiah 1:17

      “He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the
      Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness,
      and to walk humbly with your God?”

      Micah 6:8

      “Justice is the constant and perpetual will to give each
      person his due.”

      St. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae II-II, q. 58, a. 1




3.1     The Universal Cry That Reveals Our
        Nature
“That’s not fair!”

These three words, spoken countless times by children on playgrounds
and adults in boardrooms, reveal something profound about human

                                  37
Chapter 3 Justice


nature. Whether it’s a child protesting an unequal distribution of
candy or an adult witnessing corruption in government, this instinc-
tive cry emerges from the deepest part of our being. It’s not learned
behavior—it’s written on our hearts.

This universal cry for justice and our need for peace and harmony
reveals that we are created for moral order, not chaos. Every human
being, regardless of culture, education, or background, possesses an
innate sense that things ought to be fair, that people ought to be
treated with dignity, and that wrongs ought to be made right. Scrip-
ture suggests this isn’t mere social conditioning—it’s evidence of our
creation in the image of God, who is perfectly just. As St. Paul ex-
plains, even those without the written law “show that the work of
the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears
witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even defend them on
the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge people’s hidden
works through Christ Jesus.” (Romans 2:15).


3.2     What Children Know About Justice
Children demonstrate pure moral clarity about fairness before adults
complicate justice with sophisticated theories:

“That’s not fair - you’re being mean!” Children instinctively
recognize when someone is being treated badly without good reason
and know that cruelty or favoritism based on arbitrary preferences
violates human dignity.

“Stop being mean to him!” Children understand that using power
to harm the weak is evil and expect authority figures to protect the
vulnerable.

“But you promised!” Children know that breaking your word
damages trust and violates justice—reliability and truthfulness are
essential.

“You’re lying!” Children expect honesty to be rewarded and lies ex-
posed. They have an innate sense that reality matters and deception
corrupts the moral order.

                                 38
                                                      Chapter 3 Justice


“I didn’t do it!” Even when children lie to avoid punishment, their
very attempt to escape consequences reveals their deep knowledge
that wrongdoing deserves justice—they wouldn’t hide if they didn’t
know they had done something that merited correction.

“I’m telling!”       When children “tattle” on wrongdoers, they
demonstrate their instinctive understanding that justice requires
accountability—they expect authority figures to address wrongs and
restore moral order.

These simple childhood expressions reveal profound truths about jus-
tice: that every person deserves dignity and protection, that promises
create real obligations, that truth matters more than convenience,
that wrongdoing has consequences, and that legitimate authority ex-
ists to restore moral order when it’s broken. Children understand
intuitively what philosophers spend lifetimes trying to explain—that
justice isn’t arbitrary human convention but flows from the very na-
ture of humanity itself. There is no explanation in nature or evolution
for why we should have this universal moral sense, yet every child pos-
sesses it from birth.

This reflects what St. Paul describes as “the law written on their
hearts” (Romans 2:15). Jesus’ command to “become like children”
(Matthew 18:3) includes recovering this moral clarity that recognizes
injustice immediately.



3.3     The Nature of True Justice
Justice is not founded on human opinion, social convention or arbi-
trary laws—it flows from God’s own nature and is written on every
human heart through what we (philosophers dating all the way back
to Aristotle in the 4th century BC) have come to call “natural law”.
The Catechism teaches us that “the natural law expresses the original
moral sense which enables man to discern by reason the good and the
evil” (CCC 1954).

      Natural law gives us the foundation, but divine revelation
      completes our understanding of true justice.

                                  39
Chapter 3 Justice


Natural law reveals our innate desire for moral order over chaos, and
equips us with intellect and will to reason toward the good. Yet
natural law alone can only take us so far—it gives us the foundation
but not the fullness of justice.

Through Jesus Christ and His Church, we discover a more perfect
and complete understanding of true justice. Divine revelation shows
us that justice isn’t merely about balancing scales or maintaining
social order, but about restoring relationships, healing wounds, and
enabling human flourishing through love. What natural law begins as
moral intuition, Christ perfects through His radical love—revealing
that authentic justice always serves love and prepares the way for
mercy.

This is why societies rooted in Christian understanding of justice
have historically produced the most human flourishing: they build
upon natural law’s foundation while ascending to divine revelation’s
completion.


3.4     Justice Defined
      Justice is giving each person their due according to their
      nature and dignity—starting with God, then flowing to
      neighbor, self, and creation.

This classical definition, rooted in Natural Law and further devel-
oped by Scripture and Church teaching, reveals that justice has both
retributive and meritorious dimensions. As the Catechism teaches:
“Justice is the moral virtue that consists in the constant and firm will
to give their due to God and neighbor” (CCC 1807).

Retributive justice is what we typically think of as the punishment
due for wrongdoing (think about the human desire for retribution
when a child is murdered). Meritorious justice is the reward or honor
due for good or heroic (virtuous) acts (think about the human desire
for honor when a child is saved).

Retributive Justice (Punishment for Wrongdoing): Retribu-
tive justice involves bringing consequences to those who violate moral

                                  40
                                                       Chapter 3 Justice


order—“bringing them to justice” as we commonly say. This includes:

Human Justice: - Criminal punishment - Imprisonment, fines, or
other penalties for crimes - Civil penalties - Consequences for break-
ing contracts or harming others - Parental discipline - “Whoever
spares the rod hates his child” (Proverbs 13:24) - Church discipline
- Excommunication or other canonical penalties for grave sins

Divine Justice: - God’s judgment of sin - “The wages of sin is
death” (Romans 6:23) - Hell as ultimate consequence - Eternal
separation from God for those who reject His love - Purgatory as
purification - Temporal punishment to purify souls for heaven

Why Retributive Justice is Necessary:

Retributive justice serves love by protecting the innocent, deterring
future wrongdoing, and providing opportunity for the wrongdoer’s
repentance and restoration. But justice is not optional—it is essential
for human flourishing:

For the Victim: - Vindication - Justice aﬀirms that the victim’s
dignity was violated and that this violation matters - Closure -
Proper consequences help victims process trauma and move toward
healing - Protection - Justice removes dangerous offenders from so-
ciety, protecting victims from further harm - Restoration - Restitu-
tion and acknowledgment help restore what was taken or damaged

For the Perpetrator: - Moral clarity - Consequences teach the
seriousness of wrongdoing and the reality of moral order - Opportu-
nity for repentance - Punishment can lead to genuine contrition
and conversion - Deterrence - Fear of consequences helps restrain
future temptations to sin - Healing demands justice - Those gen-
uinely sorry feel they are “due” a just punishment for the pain they
caused - Restoration to community - Paying one’s debt to society
enables genuine reconciliation

For Society: - Moral order - Justice upholds the principle that
actions have consequences - Public safety - Removing dangerous
criminals protects innocent citizens - Trust in institutions - Fair
and consistent justice builds confidence in legitimate authority - De-
terrent effect - Public consequences discourage others from similar

                                  41
Chapter 3 Justice


crimes

The Danger of Failed Justice: When legitimate authorities fail to
administer justice properly—whether through corruption, weakness,
or misguided mercy—society doesn’t become more peaceful. Instead,
people lose faith in institutions and resort to vigilante justice, blood
feuds, and private revenge. This is why St. Paul emphasizes that
rulers “do not bear the sword for no reason” (Romans 13:4). Justice
is not cruelty—when carried out according to God’s Perfect Love,
it is the proper administration of truth, justice and mercy for all
concerned.

Meritorious Justice (Honor for Virtue and Dignity): Merito-
rious justice involves giving recognition, honor, and reward to those
who deserve it based on their virtue, service, or inherent dignity:

Honoring God: - Worship and adoration - “Give to the Lord the
glory due his name” (Psalm 29:2) - Thanksgiving - Recognizing all
good gifts come from Him - Obedience - Submitting to His authority
as Creator and Lord

Honoring Saints and Heroes: - Veneration of saints - Honoring
those who lived heroic virtue - Respect for martyrs - Recognizing
those who died for the faith - Gratitude to veterans - Honoring
those who served their country - Recognition of achievements -
Celebrating excellence in various fields

Honoring Family and Authority: - “Honor your father and your
mother” (Exodus 20:12) - Giving reverence to parents - Respect
for legitimate civil authority - “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s”
(Matthew 22:21) - Care for the elderly - Recognizing their wisdom
and dignity - Support for teachers - Honoring those who share
knowledge and wisdom

Honoring All Human Dignity: - Respect for every person - Be-
cause all are made in God’s image (Genesis 1:27) - Special care
for the vulnerable - “Defend the weak and the fatherless” (Psalm
82:3) - Fair wages for workers - “The laborer deserves his wages”
(Luke 10:7) - Hospitality to strangers - “Do not forget to show
hospitality to strangers” (Hebrews 13:2)

                                  42
                                                       Chapter 3 Justice


Meritorious justice recognizes that every person has inherent dignity
and that virtue, service, and excellence deserve recognition and re-
ward. The Catechism aﬀirms: “Respect for the human person pro-
ceeds by way of respect for the principle that ‘everyone should look
upon his neighbor (without any exception) as another self’ ” (CCC
1931).

Justice serves authentic love through both dimensions. Re-
tributive justice protects victims, provides moral clarity for perpetra-
tors, and maintains social order by ensuring wrongdoing has conse-
quences. Meritorious justice honors virtue, recognizes human dignity,
and rewards excellence in all its forms. Together, these two aspects
of justice create the moral framework necessary for human flourish-
ing. As Jesus teaches: “Therefore, whatever you want men to do to
you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets” (Matthew
7:12).


3.5     Divine Foundation of Justice
God is perfectly just. Justice flows from God’s nature as the
source of all moral order. As the Psalmist declares, “Justice and
judgment are the foundation of your throne; mercy and faithfulness
march before you” (Psalm 89:15). Moses confirms this truth: “The
Rock—his work is perfect; yes, all his ways are just. A faithful God,
without deceit, just and upright is he” (Deuteronomy 32:4). God’s
justice is not arbitrary but reflects His perfect knowledge of truth and
His infinite love for creation. For without a justice that is firm, we
cannot know “true love”.

Natural law written on hearts. God has inscribed basic princi-
ples of justice on every human heart, which is why even those who
don’t know Scripture instinctively recognize certain actions as right
or wrong. This universal moral sense proves that justice transcends
cultural preferences.

Objective moral order. Right and wrong exist independently of
human opinion. Justice is not determined by majority vote or cultural
consensus but by the truth about human nature and our relationship

                                  43
Chapter 3 Justice


to God.



3.6       Why We Owe God Perfect Justice
St. Thomas Aquinas, the Church’s greatest theologian and philoso-
pher, provides the systematic foundation for understanding why we
have a duty to submit to God’s authority and justice. As the master
of Catholic theology, Aquinas demonstrates that this duty flows from
three fundamental truths about reality itself:



3.7       1. God is the First Cause and Final
          End of All Things
      “God is the first principle and last end of all things.”

      St. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae I, q. 2–3; I-II, q.
      1, a. 8

Because God is our Creator, Sustainer, and Ultimate End,
we owe Him everything. Aquinas teaches that God is:

   • The First Cause - He brought us into existence from nothing
   • The Sustainer - He continually holds us in being at every
     moment
   • Our Final End - He is the one in whom perfect happiness
     consists

This means that submitting to His authority is a matter of
justice, because He is the source of all that we are and the
end for which we were made. We literally owe our existence, our
purpose, and our fulfillment to Him. To rebel against God’s justice
would be like a painting rebelling against the artist, or a symphony
refusing to follow the composer’s score.

Again, we love God because He first loved us.

                                   44
                                                       Chapter 3 Justice


3.8     2. God’s Authority Is Perfectly Good,
        True, and Just
Aquinas teaches that God is not a tyrant whose authority
we must fear, but perfect goodness whose authority we can
trust completely. God’s authority:

   • Flows from His nature, which is perfect truth, good-
     ness, and justice (cf. ST I, q. 21)
   • Orders all things wisely and lovingly toward the com-
     mon good and eternal happiness
   • Never commands anything contrary to our true good
     or authentic flourishing

Therefore, to resist God’s authority is not just disobedience—
it is irrational. It is to rebel against what is best for us. As Aquinas
explains:

      “The moral precepts of the natural law are part of the
      eternal law… therefore, we are bound to obey them.”

      St. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 91–93

When we submit to God’s justice, we are not surrendering our
freedom—we are discovering what true freedom means: the ability
to choose what is genuinely good for us and for all creation.

If we desire what is truly just, then we must ask God for
what is actually just.

The “author” of justice has true “authority”—but true authority is
never dictated from above. True authority is something we must
freely choose to submit to. This is why love of God requires
sacrifice—we must sacrifice our own will, our own desires,
our own pride to voluntarily submit to God’s justice. Only
then can we receive the perfect justice our hearts truly long for.

                                  45
Chapter 3 Justice


3.9     3. Man Is a Rational Creature Bound
        to Follow Reason, Which Reflects
        God’s Law
The deepest reason we owe God perfect justice is that we are
rational beings made in His image. Aquinas defines the natural
law as:

      “The rational creature’s participation in the eternal law.”

      St. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae I-II, q. 91, a. 2

Because we are rational beings created in God’s image, our
freedom finds its perfection not in autonomy, but in volun-
tary, humble obedience to right reason, which is a partici-
pation in God’s eternal wisdom. This means:

   • To obey God is to obey reason and truth itself
   • Following God’s justice is the very definition of freedom
     rightly lived
   • Rebelling against God’s moral order is actually
     rebelling against our own rational nature
   • True human dignity consists in freely choosing to align
     our will with divine wisdom

As rational creatures, we have the unique capacity to understand
God’s justice and freely choose to cooperate with it. This is what
makes us different from animals (who follow instinct) and angels (who
see God’s will directly). We can reason about moral truth and freely
choose to love what is good.


3.10      Why This Matters for Authentic
          Love
St. Thomas Aquinas shows us that justice toward God is the
foundation of all authentic love. When we understand that:

   • God is our First Cause and Final End - we recognize that
     loving Him is not arbitrary but rational

                                  46
                                                      Chapter 3 Justice


  • God’s authority is perfectly good and just - we trust that
    His commands lead to our flourishing
  • We are rational creatures made for truth - we see that
    obeying God’s justice is true freedom

…then we can love God, ourselves, and our neighbors authentically.
Without this foundation, our “love” becomes sentimental
preference rather than the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant
that binds truth, justice, and mercy into life-giving commu-
nion.

Aquinas teaches us that the cry for justice in every human heart
is actually a cry for God Himself—the source of all justice, the
measure of all truth, and the end of all authentic love.

The foundation of all authentic justice is the recognition that
every human being is created in the image of God (Genesis
1:27). This truth transforms justice from mere social utility
into sacred duty. If this is true, we “ought” to seek the wisdom to
enact the highest justice possible by looking to the author of justice,
God, our loving Father.


3.11 How Rights Flow from Divine Duties
It might be good to spend a bit of time reviewing how the mod-
ern convention of “rights” is based on the Christian Faith as devel-
oped throughout the history of the Church, and most specifically by
St. Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century and then culminating in
the Catholic Social Teaching by Pope Pius XII in his encyclical Re-
rum Novarum (1891). Note that these truths pre-dated the modern
convention of “rights” by several centuries.

Scripture doesn’t speak of “rights” as modern culture under-
stands them. Instead, it reveals the duties that God’s justice
requires us to practice toward all human beings. These du-
ties, when universally applied, reveal what rights ought to
exist.

Consider how God’s commandments create corresponding rights:

                                  47
Chapter 3 Justice


“Thou shall not murder” (Exodus 20:13) -> Right to Life:
Because God commands us to respect life in every person, each human
being has a right to life from conception to natural death. This duty
applies universally because every human life is sacred and bears God’s
image.

“Honor your father and mother” (Exodus 20:12) -> Right
to Family: Because God commands children to honor parents and
parents to care for children, every child has a right to both mother
and father, reflecting the complementarity of God’s image in male
and female.

“You shall not bear false witness” (Exodus 20:16) -> Right
to Truth: Because God commands us to speak truth to our neigh-
bors, every person has a right to truth about reality, morality, and
their ultimate destiny. We are rational beings made in God’s image.

“You shall not steal” (Exodus 20:15) -> Right to Property:
Because God forbids theft, every person has a right to the fruits of
their labor and the resources needed for human flourishing as stewards
of creation.

“You shall have no other gods before me” (Exodus 20:3) ->
Right to Worship: Because God commands exclusive worship of
Himself, every person has the right to worship their Creator and live
according to their conscience.

“Love your neighbor as yourself” (Mark 12:31) -> Right to
Freedom: Because God commands us to love others as ourselves,
every person has the right to authentic freedom—not license to sin,
but freedom to choose the good and fulfill their nature as God’s image-
bearers.

“Defend the weak and the fatherless” (Psalm 82:3) -> Right
to Protection: Because God commands us to defend the vulnerable,
every person has the right to protection from exploitation, abuse, and
abandonment.

“Feed the hungry, clothe the naked” (Matthew 25:35-36) -
> Right to Basic Needs: Because God commands us to care for

                                  48
                                                      Chapter 3 Justice


those in need, every person has the right to food, shelter, clothing,
and healthcare necessary for sustaining human dignity and life.

      Every right carries a corresponding duty to sacrifice for
      our neighbors’ good.

Sadly, modern society has not been taught that “rights” flow from
duties we owe to God and our neighbors. But we must know this
so that we can teach our children and anyone fighting for an inferior
“justice” or “human right” that is not based on God’s true justice.

Removing this type of teaching from our schools pulls the rug out
from under the foundation on which our society is built.


3.12 The Objective Foundation of All
     Rights
This understanding reveals that all authentic rights carry
corresponding duties, and both flow from the firm, objective
justice of God. Rights aren’t arbitrary human inventions or social
contracts—they emerge from the moral order that God has written
into creation itself.

When we ground justice in God’s commandments applied universally
to all image-bearers, we: - Prevent dehumanization by recognizing
every person’s sacred dignity - Stop utilitarian abuse by establishing
duties we owe regardless of convenience - Defend the vulnerable by
making their protection a divine command - Establish objective stan-
dards that reflect God’s unchanging character - Create a foundation
for justice that transcends cultural preferences

This is why the Church’s social teaching is so powerful—it
doesn’t merely assert rights, but grounds them in the duties
that flow from God’s own justice toward His image-bearers.


3.13 Justice as Giving Each Their Due
True justice is fundamentally about giving each being what they
are owed according to their nature, dignity, and relationship to us.

                                 49
Chapter 3 Justice


This positive understanding goes far beyond merely avoiding harm—
it actively seeks to honor the dignity and rights of every person.

Justice Toward God: - Worship and adoration - God deserves
our complete reverence as Creator and Lord - Obedience - Following
God’s commandments as acknowledgment of His authority - Grati-
tude - Recognizing all good things come from Him and giving thanks
- Trust - Believing in His goodness and providence even in diﬀiculties

Justice Toward Our Neighbor: - Respect for dignity - Treating
every person as created in God’s image - Honesty - Speaking truth
and keeping promises in all our dealings - Fairness - Giving equal
treatment regardless of personal preference - Protection - Defending
the innocent and vulnerable from harm

Justice Toward Ourselves: - Self-respect - Honoring our own
dignity as children of God - Self-discipline - Ordering our desires
according to reason and faith - Self-development - Cultivating our
talents for God’s glory


3.14      The Hierarchy of Justice: Biblical
          Foundation
Scripture reveals that different beings deserve different types and de-
grees of reverence, creating what we might call a proper ordering of
our duties. This hierarchy isn’t arbitrary but reflects the order estab-
lished by God Himself:


God First: The Great Commandment
     “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and
     with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the
     great and first commandment.” Matthew 22:37-38

Jesus teaches that our first duty of justice is to God—giving Him the
supreme worship, adoration, and obedience He deserves as Creator
and Father with our entire being - our body, mind, and soul. If you
study carefully, all the other commandments reiterate this same duty

                                  50
                                                      Chapter 3 Justice


- do not give your ‘worthship’ to things that are not God (the idols
of our hearts, money, power, lust, envy, anger, etc.)


Parents and Authority: The Fourth Commandment
     “Honor your father and your mother, that your days may
     be long in the land that the Lord your God is giving you.”

      Exodus 20:12

Scripture consistently places honor for parents and legitimate author-
ity immediately after duties to God, showing their special place in the
hierarchy of justice. This is the only one that comes with a promise
- why? Because honoring your parents (those that physically created
you) passes on the gift of God’s Perfect Love from one generation to
the next.


Neighbor as Yourself:             The Second Great Com-
mandment
     “And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as
     yourself.”

      Matthew 22:39

Jesus reveals that justice toward our neighbor must be measured by
proper justice (and mercy) toward ourselves—neither neglecting our
legitimate needs nor serving ourselves at others’ expense.


Civil and Religious Authority
     “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is
     God’s.” (Mark 12:17) “Obey your leaders and submit to
     them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those
     who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy
     and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage
     to you.”

      Hebrews 13:17

                                  51
Chapter 3 Justice


This shows that both civil and religious authority have a special place
in the hierarchy of justice, with civil authority having the duty to
protect the common good and religious authority having the duty to
protect the faith.


Creation Under Our Stewardship
     “And God said to them, ‘Be fruitful and multiply and fill
     the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish
     of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every
     living thing that moves on the earth.’ ”

      Genesis 1:28

Scripture shows that humans have a special responsibility for
creation—not as owners but as stewards accountable to God.

This biblical ordering prevents the disorder that occurs when we
give ultimate devotion to finite goods or treat unequal things as if
they were equal. As Jesus warned, “No one can serve two masters”
(Matthew 6:24).



3.15      The Integration of Justice and
          Mercy:   True Justice Demands
          Mercy
Now that we have established the Natural Law and Catholic under-
standing of justice—giving each person their due according to their
nature and dignity—we must confront a crucial truth: justice that
is not integrated with mercy ceases to be justice at all.

Consider a two-year-old child who lies to you. According to strict
justice, lying deserves punishment. But if we were to apply only
rigid justice—sending this child to prison for deception—we would
immediately recognize this as a monstrous miscarriage of justice, not
its fulfillment. The punishment fails to be truly just because it ignores
the child’s age, understanding, and the nature of the offense.

                                   52
                                                       Chapter 3 Justice


True justice requires wisdom that integrates mercy: - The
child deserves to be taught not to lie - The child deserves appropriate
correction for their age - The child deserves guidance in understanding
truth and its importance - The child deserves patience as they learn
and grow

This isn’t mercy overriding justice—this is mercy perfecting jus-
tice by ensuring the response is truly proportionate to both the per-
son and the offense. Justice without this merciful wisdom becomes
cruelty masquerading as righteousness.

The same principle applies to every human interaction. A teenager
who shoplifts needs both the justice of restitution and the mercy of
understanding why they felt compelled to steal. A spouse who speaks
harshly needs both accountability for the harm caused and the mercy
of being seen as more than their worst moment.

Justice integrated with mercy recognizes: - The full humanity
of the person before us - The circumstances that shaped their choices
- The potential for growth and transformation - The appropriate re-
sponse that truly serves their flourishing

This integration becomes clear when we remember our fundamental
definitions from Chapter 1:

     “Love is an action we take which chooses the good of others
     at our expense.”

     “Sin (or evil) is an action that we take which chooses a
     perceived good for ourselves at the expense of others.”

When we truly understand justice as giving each person their due, we
see that authentic justice is always an act of love—choosing to
honor the dignity and rights of others even when it costs us. Con-
versely, injustice is always rooted in sin—choosing our own per-
ceived good at the expense of what others are rightfully owed.

This is why authentic Catholic justice never stands alone. It always
seeks the wisdom that tempers severity with understanding, that bal-
ances accountability with compassion, that demands truth while of-
fering hope. Justice without mercy becomes merely punitive; mercy

                                  53
Chapter 3 Justice


without justice becomes merely permissive.

      True justice demands mercy - because mercy ensures that
      our response is ordered toward communion.



3.16      Jesus: The Perfect Integration of
          Justice and Mercy
Having established both the divine foundation of justice and its
necessary integration with mercy, we can now see how Jesus per-
fectly demonstrates this synthesis in authentic love. Throughout
the Gospels, we see Jesus embodying this perfect balance, never
compromising either virtue while ensuring that each perfects the
other.


The Woman Caught in Adultery (John 8:1-11)
When the scribes and Pharisees brought the woman caught in adul-
tery to Jesus, they sought to trap Him between justice and mercy.
The Law demanded stoning (justice), but they expected Jesus to show
mercy that would contradict the Law. Instead, Jesus demonstrated
perfect integration. Read the story - John 8:1-11.

He acknowledged the demands of justice: “Let him who is
without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her” (John
8:7). Jesus didn’t dismiss the Law or claim adultery wasn’t sinful.

He offered transformative mercy: “Neither do I condemn you;
go, and from now on sin no more” (John 8:11). His mercy wasn’t
permissiveness—it demanded repentance and transformation.

He revealed deeper justice: By exposing the accusers’ own sinful-
ness, Jesus showed that true justice must begin with examining our
own hearts and to re-orient them toward God’s love and mercy.

Jesus showed his deep caring for the woman through his heart of
justice and mercy.

                                54
                                                       Chapter 3 Justice


Zacchaeus: Justice Inspiring Generous Restitution
(Luke 19:1-10)
When Jesus showed mercy to Zacchaeus the tax collector, notice what
happened: Zacchaeus immediately responded with justice that went
beyond legal requirements. Read Luke 19:1-10.

     “Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor.
     And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it
     fourfold.”

      Luke 19:8

Jesus’ mercy didn’t excuse Zacchaeus’s past injustices—it inspired
him to make restitution that exceeded what the Law required (Exodus
22:1 required only double restitution for theft).

True mercy awakens the desire for justice, not the excuse to avoid it.


The Rich Young Man (Mark 10:17-22)
When the rich young man asked about eternal life, Jesus first pointed
him to justice—keeping the commandments. But then He revealed
that perfect love requires going beyond minimal justice. Read Mark
10:17-22.

     “You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to
     the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come,
     follow me.”

      Mark 10:21

Jesus showed that while justice establishes the foundation (keeping
commandments), love calls us to generous sacrifice that serves others’
needs. The young man’s sadness reveals how diﬀicult it is to move
from mere justice to perfect love.


The Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37)
When a scholar of the law asked Jesus, “Teacher, what must I do to
inherit eternal life?” he was asking the ultimate question: how to live
in communion with God forever. Jesus turned the question back to

                                  55
Chapter 3 Justice


him: “What is written in the Law? How do you read it?” The scholar
correctly answered: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your
heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with
all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.” Jesus confirmed this
as the path to eternal life, but the scholar, seeking to justify himself,
asked, “And who is my neighbor?”

In response, Jesus tells the parable of the Good Samaritan—not
merely as a moral lesson, but as the revelation of how justice and
mercy perfectly integrate in the love that leads to eternal commu-
nion with God. When a traveler is beaten, robbed, and left for dead,
both a priest and a Levite pass by—men who knew the Law and its
demands for justice, yet failed to act. The Samaritan, considered
religiously impure by Jewish standards, demonstrates authentic love
through concrete justice: in the response to human suffering. When
a traveler is beaten, robbed, and left for dead, both a priest and a
Levite pass by—men who knew the Law and its demands for jus-
tice, yet failed to act. The Samaritan, considered religiously impure
by Jewish standards, demonstrates authentic love through concrete
justice:

He recognized the man’s dignity: Despite cultural and religious
barriers, the Samaritan saw the wounded traveler not as an enemy or
stranger, but as a human being deserving of justice and mercy.

He provided immediate care: Bandaging wounds and pouring oil
and wine showed practical justice—restoring what had been violently
taken: the man’s bodily integrity and human dignity.

He went beyond minimal justice: Taking the man to an inn
and paying for his continued care demonstrated mercy that exceeded
mere legal requirements. He didn’t just meet the wounded man’s
basic needs; he ensured his complete restoration.

He took personal responsibility: By promising to return and pay
any additional costs, the Samaritan showed that authentic justice
requires ongoing commitment, not just momentary assistance.

Jesus concludes this parable by commanding us to “go and do
likewise”—to integrate justice and mercy in our response to human

                                   56
                                                      Chapter 3 Justice


need, recognizing that love for neighbor demands both truth about
human dignity and concrete action to restore what has been violated.

These Gospel examples show us that authentic justice and mercy
don’t compete—they complete each other in the perfect love that
Jesus embodies.


3.17 How Justice Serves Love
Justice is not opposed to love but is love’s foundation. Without jus-
tice, love becomes mere sentiment; without love, justice becomes cold
legalism. Perfect love requires both.

     “Justice without mercy is cruelty; mercy without justice is
     the mother of dissolution.” (Dissolution is the breakdown
     of order)

     St. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae.             Thomas
     Aquinas

     “Love will always prove necessary, even in the most just
     society.”

     — Pope Benedict XVI, Deus Caritas Est

Creates Order: Justice establishes the conditions in which love can
flourish. When people know their rights will be respected and their
dignity honored, they can trust enough to love.

Protects the Vulnerable: Justice defends those who cannot defend
themselves, creating space for the weak to experience love without
fear.

Enables Trust: Justice creates the reliability necessary for deep
relationships. We can only love those we trust to treat us justly.

Demands Truth: Justice requires honesty about what is real and
what is good. Love built on lies is not authentic love.

Prepares for Mercy: Justice establishes the moral order that makes
mercy meaningful. Mercy is only beautiful when it applies and tran-
scends justice, not when it ignores it. As Isaiah proclaims, “Truly,

                                 57
Chapter 3 Justice


the LORD is waiting to be gracious to you, truly, he shall rise to
show you mercy; For the LORD is a God of justice: happy are all
who wait for him!” (Isaiah 30:18).

      Today’s urgent cries for justice can only find their com-
      plete answer in the perfect harmony of God’s truth, jus-
      tice, and mercy.

This is the heart of Catholic justice: not mere retribution, but restora-
tion that heals both victim and perpetrator through the transforming
power of merciful love.

God’s mercy flows from His perfect justice - true justice and mercy
are intertwined!



3.18      The Cry for Justice in Our Time
The universal cry for justice is particularly urgent in our contempo-
rary world, where fundamental human rights face serious challenges:

      “Justice is both the aim and the intrinsic criterion of all
      politics. Politics is more than a mere mechanism for defin-
      ing the rules of public life: its origin and its goal are found
      in justice, which by its very nature has to do with ethics.”

     — Pope Benedict XVI, Deus Caritas Est

Threats to Human Dignity: When societies fail to recognize that
every person is created in God’s image, they risk treating some lives
as less valuable than others. This affects the most vulnerable—the
unborn, elderly, disabled, and poor.

Breakdown of Family Structure: Children thrive when raised
in stable families with both mother and father. When this founda-
tion is weakened, children suffer and society loses its most important
institution for forming virtue.

Economic Injustice: The exploitation of workers and the extreme
concentration of wealth can violate human dignity. Scripture consis-
tently calls for fair wages and care for the poor.

                                    58
                                                      Chapter 3 Justice


Religious Freedom: The freedom to worship God according to con-
science is fundamental to human dignity. When this freedom is re-
stricted, people cannot fulfill their most basic duty of justice toward
their Creator.

Cultural Confusion: When societies lose sight of objective moral
truth, it becomes diﬀicult to distinguish between authentic justice
and its counterfeits.

Each of these challenges calls us to apply the principles of justice
grounded in human dignity and ordered toward the common good.



3.19 What Evil This Overcomes
The virtue of justice directly combats the evil of dehumanization
and exploitation—the tendency to treat human beings as less than
the image-bearers of God they truly are.

Personal Evil: Justice conquers the selfishness that ignores others’
rights, the pride that demands special treatment, and the greed that
exploits the vulnerable for personal gain.

Relational Evil: Justice heals broken trust, stops the cycle of re-
venge, and prevents the abuse of power that destroys families and
friendships.

Societal Evil: Justice confronts systemic oppression, economic ex-
ploitation, and the cultural lies that deny human dignity based on
race, class, or convenience.

Spiritual Evil: Justice defeats the fundamental lie that some human
lives matter less than others, restoring the truth that every person
bears God’s image and deserves respect.

Without justice, love becomes mere sentiment that enables evil to
flourish. With justice, love gains the backbone necessary to defend
the vulnerable and create the order in which authentic relationships
can thrive.

Chapter 3 Justice


3.20      Justice and the Integration of Body,
          Mind, and Soul
True justice requires the engagement of our entire being—body, mind,
and soul working in harmony:

Body: Justice demands physical action—defending the vulnerable,
working honestly, caring for our own health as stewards of God’s gift,
and using our strength to protect rather than exploit.

Mind: Justice requires clear thinking—studying moral principles,
understanding natural law, discerning between authentic rights and
false claims, and reasoning through complex ethical situations.

Soul: Justice flows from our spiritual relationship with God—
recognizing His image in others, submitting to His moral order, and
allowing His grace to transform our selfish hearts into instruments of
His righteousness.

When body, mind, and soul are integrated in the pursuit of justice,
we become effective agents of God’s love in the world. When they
are divided—when our actions contradict our beliefs, or our emotions
override our reason—our pursuit of justice becomes compromised and
ineffective.

Heavenly Father, You are perfectly just and perfectly loving. Help
us to see every person as created in Your image and deserving of
dignity and respect. Give us courage to defend the vulnerable, wisdom
to discern true justice from its counterfeits, and hearts that cry out
against injustice wherever we find it. May we be instruments of Your
justice in our families, communities, and world, always remembering
that true justice serves love and prepares the way for mercy. Through
Christ our Lord. Amen.


3.21      Living the Response
The cry for justice is not merely something we observe—it’s a call to
action. As followers of Christ, we are called to be agents of justice
in our families, communities, and world. Scripture provides clear

                                 60
                                                      Chapter 3 Justice


guidance for how to live this calling.

In Our Hearts: Jesus taught that authentic justice begins within:
“First take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly
to take the speck out of your brother’s eye” (Matthew 7:5). We must
examine our consciences regularly: Do we give God the worship He
deserves? Do we treat others with the dignity they possess as image-
bearers? Do we respect our own dignity through proper self-care and
moral living?

In Our Families: Scripture calls us to practice justice first in our
homes. This means keeping promises, treating family members fairly,
and teaching children to recognize and respond to injustice. As
Deuteronomy 6:6-7 commands: “These words that I command you
today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your
children.”

In Our Communities: The prophets consistently called God’s peo-
ple to defend the vulnerable and speak truth in love. Isaiah 1:17
commands: “Learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; bring
justice to the fatherless, plead the widow’s cause.” This means work-
ing for policies that protect human dignity from conception to natural
death.

In Our World: Jesus calls us to be “salt of the earth” and “light
of the world” (Matthew 5:13-14). This includes supporting organiza-
tions that fight human traﬀicking, defend religious freedom, protect
the unborn, and promote authentic human development. Our justice
must extend beyond our immediate circle to embrace all who bear
God’s image.


3.22 Examen: Justice in Daily Life
Morning: Before beginning each day, ask yourself: “How can I give
each person their due today? How can I honor God’s image in myself
and others?”

Evening: Reflect on the day: “Did I treat others with the dignity
they deserve? Did I speak truth in love? Did I defend the vulner-

                                  61
Chapter 3 Justice


able when I had the opportunity? Did I give God the worship and
gratitude He deserves?”

Weekly: Consider your patterns: “Am I growing in my ability to rec-
ognize injustice? Am I becoming more courageous in defending what
is right? Am I integrating justice and mercy in my relationships?”

Mercy

      “Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.”

      — Luke 6:36

      “Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.”

      — Matthew 5:7




4.1     The Ache That Reveals Our Broken-
        ness
“I’m sorry! Please give me another chance!”

These words, spoken by children who’ve broken a treasured vase and
adults who’ve broken a treasured relationship, reveal something pro-
found about the human condition. Whether it’s a five-year-old who
accidentally hurt a friend or a fifty-year-old who betrayed a spouse’s
trust, this desperate plea emerges from the deepest part of our being.
It’s not learned behavior—it’s the cry of a heart that knows it has
fallen short and desperately needs to forgive and be forgiven.

This universal cry for mercy reveals that we are created for perfect
love but wounded by sin. Every human being, from the moment of

                                  63
Chapter 4 Mercy


consciousness, experiences the reality of failure, mistake, and wrong-
doing. This universal experience creates an equally universal cry for
mercy—the desperate need for forgiveness, understanding, and a sec-
ond chance. This cry echoes from every human heart because we are
all wounded by original sin and personal sin, yet created for perfect
love.


4.2     Justice and Mercy: Partners in Per-
        fect Love
      Mercy does not oppose justice—it perfects it by restoring
      what justice alone cannot heal.

As we explored in Chapter 3, justice and mercy are not opposing
forces but complementary expressions of perfect love. Justice gives
each person what they deserve; mercy gives what they need for healing
and restoration. Both flow from love’s desire for the authentic good
of the other.

How Mercy and Justice Work Together: - Justice establishes
the foundation: Without justice, mercy becomes mere sentiment
that enables evil to continue unchecked - Mercy completes the
work: Justice alone can punish wrongdoing, but only mercy can
heal the wounds that wrongdoing creates - Both serve love: Justice
protects the innocent and upholds moral order; mercy restores the
guilty and heals relationships

The Church’s Social Teaching: This integration of mercy and jus-
tice extends beyond personal relationships to social structures. The
Church’s social teaching, founded by Pope Leo XIII in his ground-
breaking encyclical Rerum Novarum (1891), calls us to build a civi-
lization of love where both justice and mercy flourish. Pope Francis
reminds us that “mercy is not opposed to justice but rather embodies
God’s way of reaching out to the sinner, offering him a new chance to
look at himself, convert, and believe” (Misericordiae Vultus, 21). This
means working for economic systems that are both just (providing fair
wages and opportunities) and merciful (caring for the vulnerable and
marginalized).

                                                      Chapter 4 Mercy


Practical Integration: In family life, this means parents who estab-
lish clear boundaries (justice) while offering forgiveness and second
chances (mercy). In society, it means legal systems that punish crime
(justice) while working toward rehabilitation and restoration (mercy).
In the Church, it means upholding moral teaching (justice) while ac-
companying sinners on their journey toward conversion (mercy).



4.3     What Children Know About Mercy
Children demonstrate pure understanding of mercy before adults com-
plicate it with theological theories:

“Everyone makes mistakes!” Children naturally understand that
people aren’t perfect and readily acknowledge when they’ve done
something wrong.

“I’m sorry!” Children know sincere apologies matter and that ac-
knowledging wrongdoing is the first step toward healing.

“Can we still be friends?” Children separate the person from
their bad behavior, loving someone while disapproving of what they’ve
done.

“Let’s try again!” Children believe in second chances and don’t
write people off as hopeless. They instinctively believe people can
change.

“It’s okay, I forgive you!” Children forgive quickly and com-
pletely, often forgetting the offense entirely without keeping mental
scorecards.

This childlike mercy reflects God’s own heart: “quick to forgive, slow
to anger, and rich in compassion” (Psalm 103:8). Jesus’ command
to “become like children” includes recovering this tender heart that
refuses to let past hurts define future relationships.

Mercy is a beautiful gift from God embedded deep within our soul.

                                 65
Chapter 4 Mercy


4.4     The Nature of True Mercy
      True mercy is not weakness—it is love choosing the harder
      path of healing over the easier path of rejection.

Mercy is not mere sentiment or weakness. True mercy is powerful
act of the will that chooses to forgive rather than punish, to
heal rather than harm, to restore rather than reject. It’s one
of the most demanding expressions of love because it requires us to
transcend our natural desire for retribution, punishment, or rejection
and choose the harder path of healing.

Saint Thomas Aquinas provides the classic definition: “Mercy is the
compassion in our hearts for another person’s misery, a com-
passion which drives us to do what we can to help him.” This
definition reveals mercy’s dual nature. It begins with compassion—
feeling with the suffering person. But true mercy doesn’t stop there.
It moves from feeling to action, from sympathy to healing.

Where sin holds on to injury, pride, resentment, and rejection at
the expense of others, love draws us back to mercy, forgiveness, and
healing for the sake of the other, ourselves and our relationship with
God.

Understanding this nature of mercy helps us see how it operates in
two essential ways:



4.5     Mercy Sees the Person Behind the Sin
True mercy recognizes that every human being is created in the image
of God, regardless of what they have done. This doesn’t mean mercy
ignores sin or pretends wrongdoing doesn’t matter. Rather, mercy
sees the full truth: yes, this person has sinned, but they are still a
beloved child of God with infinite dignity and the potential
for redemption.

The woman caught in adultery (John 8:1-11) experienced this kind of
mercy from Jesus. He didn’t deny her sin—“Go and sin no more”—
but He saw beyond her failure to her fundamental dignity as a human

                                 66
                                                        Chapter 4 Mercy


being created for love. His mercy didn’t excuse her adultery; it offered
her a path to authentic love.


4.6     Mercy Chooses Love Over Justice
        Alone
Justice gives each person what they deserve; mercy gives what they
need. A parent whose child breaks a window deserves to have it
replaced (justice), but the child needs forgiveness and guidance more
than punishment (mercy). A spouse who has been betrayed deserves
an apology and changed behavior (justice), but the marriage needs
healing and renewed commitment (mercy).

This doesn’t mean mercy ignores justice. As we explored in Chap-
ter 3, justice and mercy are not opposites but partners in perfect
love, unified expressions of God’s nature that work together to restore
what sin has broken. Saint Thomas Aquinas explains this perfectly:
“Mercy obeys reason, when mercy is vouchsafed in such a
way that justice is safeguarded.” True mercy never violates jus-
tice but transcends it, offering healing that goes beyond what justice
alone can provide.


4.7     The Biblical Foundation of Mercy
      Mercy is not a human invention—it is who God is, re-
      vealed from Genesis to Revelation.

Having established mercy’s nature, we can now explore how Scrip-
ture reveals this truth about God’s own heart. Mercy is not a human
invention but a reflection of God’s own nature. From the Old Testa-
ment to the New, we see that mercy is central to who God is and how
He relates to His creation.

God’s Mercy in the Old Testament: The Hebrew word for mercy,
hesed, appears over 240 times in the Old Testament and describes
God’s steadfast, covenant love. Psalm 136 repeats twenty-six times:
“His mercy endures forever.”

                                  67
Chapter 4 Mercy


     “The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to
     anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness”

     — Exodus 34:6

This divine self-revelation shows that mercy is not just something
God does—it’s who God is.

Mercy as Divine Attribute: The Catechism teaches that “God’s
mercy is His loving-kindness, His grace, His love for us that goes
beyond what we deserve” (CCC 1422).

     “The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and
     abounding in steadfast love… As a father shows compas-
     sion to his children, so the Lord shows compassion to those
     who fear him. For he knows our frame; he remembers that
     we are dust.”

     — Psalm 103:8-14

Prophetic Calls to Mercy: The prophets consistently called God’s
people to practice mercy.

     “I desire mercy, not sacrifice.”

     — Hosea 6:6

This doesn’t mean God rejects sacrifice—as we’ll see throughout this
book, sacrifice is essential to perfect love. Rather, God desires the sac-
rifice that flows from a merciful heart, not empty ritualistic offerings
disconnected from love of neighbor.

     “Show mercy and compassion every one to his brother.”

     — Zechariah 7:9

These aren’t suggestions but divine imperatives that flow from God’s
own merciful nature.

Jesus as the Face of Mercy: In the New Testament, Jesus reveals
mercy as the very heart of God’s relationship with humanity. He
declares, “Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful” (Luke 6:36).
The parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37) shows justice
and mercy in action—crossing boundaries to heal and restore - a

                                   68

requirement for salvation according to Jesus. The parable of the
Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32) reveals the Father’s just (because the
son is worthy of love) and merciful heart that runs to embrace the
returning sinner.

The Cross as Ultimate Mercy: Saint John Paul II taught that
“the cross is the most profound condescension of God to man… it is
mercy” (Dives in Misericordia, 8). On the cross, God’s justice and
mercy meet perfectly—justice is satisfied and mercy is poured out
abundantly. As the Catechism explains: “God’s mercy is His loving-
kindness, His grace, His love for us that goes beyond what we deserve”
(CCC 1422).

Mercy and the Trinity: The Catechism reveals that mercy flows
from the very life of the Trinity, showing us how each Person of the
Godhead expresses perfect mercy: “The Father is merciful because He
is love itself (1 John 4:8), the source of all mercy. The Son reveals the
Father’s mercy through His incarnation, passion, and resurrection—
becoming mercy incarnate for our salvation. The Holy Spirit is the
gift of mercy, poured into our hearts to enable us to be merciful as the
Father is merciful” (CCC 1829, 1832). This Trinitarian foundation
shows that when we practice mercy, we participate in the very life of
God.


4.8     Mercy Breaks Cycles and Creates
        Space for Redemption
      Mercy breaks cycles of revenge by choosing to absorb hurt
      rather than pass it on.

This biblical understanding helps us see why mercy is so transfor-
mative in human relationships. Without mercy, human relationships
become trapped in endless cycles of hurt and revenge. You hurt me,
so I hurt you back. You retaliate, so I escalate. Soon, the original
offense is forgotten in the spiral of mutual destruction. Mercy breaks
this cycle by choosing to absorb the hurt rather than pass it on.

But mercy is not just a nice gesture—it’s actually required by justice

                                   69
Chapter 4 Mercy


itself. When we are wounded by sin (our own or others’), we become
incapable of fulfilling our fundamental purpose as human beings: to
love God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength, and to love
our neighbor as ourselves (Mark 12:30-31). Unhealed wounds create
barriers to authentic love. Bitterness prevents us from loving our
enemies. Shame prevents us from receiving God’s love. Unforgiveness
prevents us from loving ourselves properly. Justice demands that
these wounds be healed so we can become who God created us to
be—beings capable of perfect love.

     “He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim
     freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the
     prisoners”

     — Isaiah 61:1

This is true salvation—not just forgiveness of the penalty of sins,
but authentic healing that restores our capacity for love.

     “Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our
     debtors”

     — Matthew 6:12

Jesus makes clear that our willingness to forgive others is the condi-
tion for receiving His forgiveness—not because we earn it, but because
refusing to forgive others is a barrier to receiving God’s mercy our-
selves (Matthew 5:23-24, CCC 2839-2840). When we refuse to forgive,
we break the chain of mercy and trap ourselves in bitterness. Justice
also demands that we forgive others, for we too have been forgiven by
God (Matthew 6:14-15). Another place where love requires sacri-
fice.

Perhaps most importantly, mercy opens the heart to genuine repen-
tance and transformation. When someone is crushed by guilt and
shame, they often become defensive and closed to change. But when
they experience genuine mercy—forgiveness they don’t deserve—their
hearts often soften and open to the possibility of becoming better.
The Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32) experienced this transformative
power of mercy. His father’s extravagant welcome didn’t excuse the
son’s wasteful living, but it prepared the ground for genuine repen-

                                 70
                                                      Chapter 4 Mercy


tance and restoration. Mercy doesn’t guarantee transformation, but
it makes transformation possible. Had the Father demanded only
“justice,” both father and son might have suffered in bitterness and
resentment rather than being restored to love.

For Those Who Have Been Deeply Hurt

If you carry wounds that feel too heavy to forgive—if betrayal, abuse,
or cruelty has left you broken—know this: God’s mercy does not
demand that you deny your pain or pretend the hurt didn’t
matter. Instead, His mercy offers to carry the weight with you.

The same Jesus who wept at Lazarus’ tomb weeps with you now. The
same Father who ran to embrace the Prodigal Son runs toward your
wounded heart. Mercy begins not with forgetting, but with
being seen—with God Himself acknowledging the full reality of what
was done to you and saying, “This should never have happened. Let
me heal what was broken.”

You don’t have to be ready to forgive today. But you can be ready
to let God begin the healing. His mercy is stronger than your
wounds, and His love is more powerful than the evil done to you.

Begin your healing in the Sacraments. Bring your wounds to
the Sacrament of Reconciliation, where Christ Himself speaks
words of absolution over your broken heart. Kneel at the altar rail
and receive the Body and Blood of the One who was wounded
for your transgressions. Let the Mass become your daily place of
healing, where the eternal sacrifice of love transforms your pain into
redemption. In the Eucharist, you meet the same Jesus who wept
at Lazarus’ tomb—now present to weep with you and heal you. The
Church’s liturgy is not escape from your wounds, but the place
where God enters them and begins to make all things new.


4.9     Mercy in the Face of Evil
This transformative power of mercy raises important questions about
how to respond when we encounter genuine evil—not mere mistakes
or weaknesses, but deliberate cruelty, abuse, or injustice. Does mercy

                                 71
Chapter 4 Mercy


require us to be doormats? Does forgiveness mean ignoring justice?


4.10      Mercy Does Not Mean Enabling Evil
     True mercy seeks the sinner’s authentic good, which some-
     times requires allowing suffering to serve healing.

True mercy seeks the authentic good of the other person (justice),
which sometimes means allowing them to face the consequences of
their actions. A parent who never disciplines a child isn’t showing
mercy—they’re enabling (and thus teaching) destructive behavior. A
society that refuses to prosecute criminals isn’t merciful—it’s aban-
doning its duty to protect the innocent and even causing more harm
to the perpetrator.

Mercy can coexist with appropriate consequences. We can forgive
someone while still maintaining healthy boundaries. We can show
compassion while still seeking justice. We can pray for someone’s con-
version while still protecting ourselves and others from their harmful
behavior. St. John Paul II demonstrated this perfectly when
he not only forgave Mehmet Ali Ağca—the man who shot him in
1981—but later visited him in prison and maintained a relationship
with him. The Pope didn’t demand Ağca’s release or suggest he
shouldn’t face justice. Instead, he showed that true mercy seeks the
sinner’s authentic good, which includes acknowledging the gravity of
their actions and allowing them to face appropriate consequences.

Mercy given without justice is not mercy at all—it’s false compassion
that enables sin to continue. Like a doctor who gives painkillers to
someone with a serious infection instead of treating the underlying
disease, such “mercy” may provide temporary comfort but allows the
spiritual poison of sin to spread and cause greater harm.


4.11      Mercy Toward the Unrepentant
Perhaps the most diﬀicult mercy is showing compassion toward those
who show no remorse for their actions. Jesus provides the model
from the cross: “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they

                                 72
                                                      Chapter 4 Mercy


do” (Luke 23:34). He showed mercy to His executioners even while
they were killing Him, even though they showed no repentance. This
mercy didn’t excuse their actions or eliminate consequences, but it
freed Jesus from bitterness and opened the door for their eventual
conversion.

Mercy toward the unrepentant protects our own hearts from the poi-
son of hatred while leaving the door open for their future repentance.
We forgive not because they deserve it, but because we are called
to reflect God’s mercy and because unforgiveness destroys our own
souls.


4.12 What Evil Mercy Overcomes
Mercy conquers the evil of hardness of heart and the cycle of ret-
ribution that perpetuates suffering. When mercy is absent, several
specific evils flourish:

Personal Evil: Without mercy, we become prisoners of our past
pain. Unforgiveness poisons our hearts with bitterness, resentment,
and hatred. We become defined by what others have done to us or
even by our own sins rather than allowing that past pain to heal.

Relational Evil: Without mercy, relationships become scorekeeping
contests where every offense is remembered and every slight is repaid.
Love dies under the weight of accumulated grievances, and families,
friendships, and marriages dissolve in cycles of mutual recrimination.

Societal Evil: Without mercy, societies become harsh and vindic-
tive, focused more on punishment than restoration. Justice becomes
revenge, and the goal shifts from healing communities to satisfying
anger. This creates cultures of fear and division rather than hope and
reconciliation.

Spiritual Evil: Without mercy, we lose sight of our own need for
God’s forgiveness. We become self-righteous and judgmental, forget-
ting that we too are sinners in need of grace. This spiritual pride
separates us from God and makes us incapable of authentic love.

True mercy conquers these evils by breaking cycles of hurt, healing

                                 73
Chapter 4 Mercy


wounded hearts, restoring broken relationships, and creating commu-
nities of hope and redemption.




4.13      Mercy and the Integration of Body,
          Mind, and Soul
As we’ve seen throughout this exploration, true mercy—like all au-
thentic expressions of love—requires the engagement of our entire
being. Just as justice demanded the integration of body, mind, and
soul (as we saw in Chapter 3), mercy too calls for this complete human
response:

Body: Mercy demands physical action—embracing those who have
hurt us, serving those in need, visiting the sick and imprisoned, and
using our strength to comfort rather than condemn. The works of
mercy are fundamentally embodied acts of compassion.

Mind: Mercy requires clear thinking—understanding the difference
between mercy and permissiveness, discerning when consequences
serve healing, reasoning through complex situations of forgiveness,
and studying the Church’s teaching on mercy and reconciliation.

Soul: Mercy flows from our spiritual relationship with God—
recognizing our own need for forgiveness, allowing God’s mercy to
heal our wounded hearts, and becoming channels of His compassion
to others. We cannot give what we have not received.

When body, mind, and soul are integrated in the practice of mercy,
we become effective instruments of God’s healing love in the world.
When they are divided—when our actions contradict our beliefs, or
our emotions override our reason—our mercy becomes either inef-
fective sentimentality or harsh judgment disguised as righteousness.
This is why the confessional is so powerful: it calls us to integrate our
entire being in the practice of mercy. We will discuss this in more
detail in Chapter 8.

                                   74
                                                       Chapter 4 Mercy


4.14 The Need for Divine Grace in Mercy
     True mercy is beyond human capacity—we need divine
     grace to forgive what seems unforgivable.

This integration of our entire being in the practice of mercy reveals a
sobering truth: even with the best intentions, we often find our hearts
hardened by pain, our minds clouded by hurt, and our wills weakened
by the wounds others have inflicted upon us. This is where we dis-
cover our absolute need for divine grace. True mercy—especially to-
ward those who have deeply wounded us—is often beyond our natural
human capacity.

When Our Hearts Are Hardened: Sometimes the pain runs so
deep that we cannot forgive on our own strength. A parent whose
child was murdered, a spouse betrayed by infidelity, a person abused
by those who should have protected them—these wounds can create
such hardness of heart that mercy seems impossible. In these mo-
ments, we need something more powerful than human willpower: we
need the grace of God.

The Holy Spirit as Our Helper: Saint Paul reminds us that “the
Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for
as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings
too deep for words” (Romans 8:26). When we are too wounded to
forgive, too angry to show mercy, or too hurt to pray for our enemies,
the Holy Spirit intercedes for us and strengthens us. The Holy Spirit
is our divine assistance in mercy, softening hearts that have been
hardened by pain, opening minds to see others as God sees them,
and strengthening wills to choose forgiveness even when everything
in us cries out for revenge.

Mercy and Purification: God’s mercy doesn’t just forgive our
sins—it purifies and heals the wounds that sin leaves behind. The
Church teaches that Purgatory itself is an expression of God’s mercy,
not punishment. God loves us too much to leave us wounded by sin’s
effects. His mercy addresses both the eternal consequences of sin
(through forgiveness) and the earthly consequences (through purifi-
cation and healing). Even in this life, God’s purifying mercy works

                                  75
Chapter 4 Mercy


through suffering united to Christ’s passion, gradually healing our
hearts and making us more capable of perfect love. We can extend
this mercy to others by praying for the faithful departed and by al-
lowing God to purify our own hearts through the trials He permits.

The Sacrament of Reconciliation: God’s Mercy Made Tan-
gible: Jesus himself instituted this sacrament when he breathed on
the apostles and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins
of any, they are forgiven them; if you withhold forgiveness from any,
it is withheld” (John 20:22-23). He gave his Church “the ministry
of reconciliation” (2 Corinthians 5:18), and Saint James instructs us
to “confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that
you may be healed” (James 5:16). In the confessional, we experience
mercy in three profound ways:

• We receive mercy for our own sins: When we confess our sins,
we experience God’s mercy toward us. The priest, acting in persona
Christi, speaks the words of absolution that make God’s forgiveness
tangible and certain.

• We receive counsel for extending mercy: The priest can pro-
vide spiritual direction on how to forgive those who have hurt us,
offering practical wisdom rooted in Scripture and Church teaching.

• We receive grace to be merciful: The sacrament doesn’t just
forgive our sins—it pours grace into our souls, strengthening us to
live as merciful people. This grace enables us to forgive even when
our natural inclination is toward bitterness.

When Direct Reconciliation Is Impossible: The Sacrament of
Reconciliation becomes especially precious for those who have com-
mitted grave sins and/or may never be able to ask forgiveness directly
from their victims. The murderer whose victim is dead. The drunk
driver who killed a family. The abuser whose victim has died or disap-
peared. The soldier haunted by civilian casualties. The person whose
betrayal preceded another’s suicide.

These souls carry a burden that human reconciliation alone cannot
heal. They have created evil “in the world”—some breaking of the
Body of Christ—and feel the agonizing desire to receive both punish-

                                  76
                                                         Chapter 4 Mercy


ment and absolution. This is precisely why Christ gave His Church
the power to forgive sins: for those moments when human reconcilia-
tion is impossible but divine reconciliation is absolutely necessary.

In the confessional, these wounded souls find what they cannot find
anywhere else:

• The certainty of God’s forgiveness: When human forgiveness is
impossible to obtain, divine forgiveness is still available. The priest’s
absolution makes Christ’s mercy audible, tangible and certain, even
for the gravest sins.

• Appropriate penance: The penance given by the priest provides
a concrete way to truly show the remorse for the sin, addressing the
deep human need to “pay back” what was destroyed, even when direct
restitution is impossible. Practical note, in the confessional, you are
able to ask for a penance that more appropriately satisfies your need
to “pay back” what was destroyed.

• Spiritual counsel for living with consequences: The priest
can provide guidance on how to live with the lasting consequences
of grave sin while trusting in God’s mercy—how to find meaning in
suffering, how to serve others as a form of ongoing penance, how to
resist despair.

• Integration of justice and mercy: The confessional uniquely
provides both the justice the conscience demands (through acknowl-
edgment of sin and penance) and the mercy the heart desperately
needs (through absolution and grace).

• Healing of spiritual wounds: Grave sin doesn’t just harm
others—it wounds the sinner’s own soul. The sacrament provides
the grace necessary to heal these deep spiritual wounds and restore
the capacity for authentic love.

• The power of speaking sins aloud: The confessional engages
our entire being—body, mind, and soul—in the act of reconciliation.
Speaking our sins out loud with our voice (body), acknowledging
them clearly in our understanding (mind), and feeling genuine sorrow
in our heart (soul) creates a complete act of confession that involves
our whole person. This verbal confession breaks the power of shame

                                   77
Chapter 4 Mercy


and secrecy that often keeps us trapped in sin, while the physical act
of speaking makes the invisible reality of sin tangible and the invisible
reality of forgiveness equally real and certain.

This is why the Church has always insisted that no sin is too great for
God’s mercy, and why the Sacrament of Reconciliation is available
even to those who have committed the most heinous crimes. The
mercy of the confessional reaches into the darkest corners of human
experience, offering hope to those who might otherwise despair, and
providing a path toward redemption even when human reconciliation
is impossible.



4.15      The Confessional as School of Mercy
Regular confession teaches us mercy by repeatedly showing us God’s
mercy toward our own failures. As we experience forgiveness for our
pride, our selfishness, our failures to love, we begin to understand how
desperately others need the same mercy we have received. The priest’s
gentle counsel and Christ’s certain absolution soften our hearts and
make us more capable of extending mercy to others.

Grace Perfects Nature: Saint Thomas Aquinas taught that “grace
does not destroy nature but perfects it.” Our natural capacity for
mercy—limited though it may be—is elevated and strengthened by
divine grace. What seems impossible to forgive becomes possible
through the power of the Holy Spirit working in our hearts.

This is why the Church has always taught that mercy is both a human
virtue and a divine gift. We must cooperate with grace, but we cannot
achieve true mercy through willpower alone. We need the sacraments,
we need prayer, we need the community of the Church, and we need
the ongoing assistance of the Holy Spirit to become truly merciful
people.

And this is why the seal of the confessional is so critical. It allows any-
one, no matter the severity of their sin, to approach and receive God’s
mercy, his healing, his forgiveness so that we might be reconciled to
God and to one another.

                                    78

4.16 Living the Response
The cry for mercy is not merely something we observe—it’s a call to
action. As followers of Christ, we are called to be agents of mercy
in our families, communities, and world. Scripture provides clear
guidance for how to live this calling.

It also keeps us focused on our love for Christ and our desire for
Communion in Him. To abide in Him and to receive Communion in
Him - the Eucharist which will discuss in more detail in Chapter 10.

     We need to learn mercy so that we can give it.

In Our Hearts:

     “Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy”

     — Matthew 5:7

We must examine our consciences regularly: Do we harbor unforgive-
ness toward those who have hurt us? Do we show compassion toward
those who fail? Do we seek to understand before seeking to be under-
stood?

In Our Families: Scripture calls us to practice mercy first in our
homes. This means forgiving quickly, speaking gently when correct-
ing, and creating an atmosphere where family members feel safe to
admit mistakes and seek forgiveness. As Ephesians 4:32 commands:
“Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God
in Christ forgave you.” This can be especially diﬀicult if we were not
taught this growing up. But it is up to us with God’s healing and
help to break this cycle and teach it to our children.

In Our Communities: The works of mercy—both corporal and
spiritual—provide concrete ways to live mercy in our communities.
Feeding the hungry, visiting the sick, comforting the afflicted, in-
structing the ignorant, and forgiving offenses are all expressions of
the mercy we’ve received from God. The Church’s preferential op-
tion for the poor flows directly from mercy—recognizing that those
who suffer most need mercy most urgently. True mercy calls us not
just to individual acts of kindness but to work for just systems that

                                 79
Chapter 4 Mercy


protect the vulnerable and address the root causes of suffering. The
root causes can include financial, social, political and spiritual injus-
tices.

For a deeper exploration of how mercy shapes our social responsibil-
ities, see the Church’s rich tradition of social teaching, particularly
the encyclicals Rerum Novarum, Centesimus Annus, and Laudato Si’.

In Our World: Jesus calls us to be “peacemakers” (Matthew 5:9),
which requires the courage to break cycles of violence and retribution
through mercy. This includes supporting restorative justice programs,
advocating for the rehabilitation of offenders, and working for recon-
ciliation in divided communities.

Merciful Father, You have shown us infinite mercy through Your Son
Jesus Christ. Help us to receive Your mercy with grateful hearts and
to extend that same mercy to others. When we are hurt, give us
the strength to forgive. When others fail, help us to see them as
You see them—beloved children in need of grace. Break the cycles of
hurt and revenge in our families, communities, and world. Make us
instruments of Your mercy, that through us others might experience
the healing power of Your love. As Saint Faustina prayed: “O Lord,
I want to be completely transformed into Your mercy and to be Your
living reflection. May the greatest of all divine attributes, that of Your
unfathomable mercy, pass through my heart and soul to my neighbour.”
Through Christ our Lord. Amen.


4.17       Examen: Mercy in Daily Life
Morning: Before beginning each day, ask yourself: “How can I show
mercy today? Who in my life needs forgiveness or compassion? How
can I reflect God’s mercy in my interactions?”

Evening: Reflect on the day: “Did I show mercy to those who failed
or hurt me? Did I forgive quickly or hold grudges? Did I see others
as God sees them—beloved children in need of grace? Did I accept
mercy gracefully when I needed it?”

Weekly: Consider your patterns: “Am I growing in my ability to

                                   80
                                                       Chapter 4 Mercy


forgive? Am I becoming more compassionate toward those who strug-
gle? Am I integrating justice and mercy in my relationships? Am I
allowing God’s mercy to heal my own wounds?”

Monthly: Examine deeper patterns: “Are there people I still need
to forgive? Are there ways I’m blocking God’s mercy in my life? How
is my practice of mercy affecting my family and community?”

Act of Mercy: Each day, perform one specific act of mercy—forgive
someone who has hurt you, show kindness to someone who has been
diﬀicult, or offer a second chance to someone who has failed.

Sorrowful Mysteries of the Rosary: Consider praying the Sor-
rowful Mysteries, which reveal Christ’s ultimate act of mercy through
His passion and death. As you meditate on His agony, scourging,
crowning with thorns, carrying of the cross, and crucifixion, ask for
the grace to unite your own sufferings to His and to extend His mercy
to others. The Sorrowful Mysteries show us that mercy is not weak-
ness but the strongest love—love willing to suffer for the salvation of
others.

truth, and we instinctively know when something doesn’t align with

5.2     Why Truth Comes After Justice and
        Mercy
You might wonder: if truth is so foundational, why are we exploring
it after justice and mercy? The answer reveals something beautiful
about how authentic love develops in our hearts and minds.

In Chapters 3 and 4, we experienced the universal human cry for
justice (“That’s not fair!”) and mercy (“Please forgive me!”). These
cries emerge naturally from our hearts because we are made in God’s
image. Every child knows when something is unjust, and every person
who has ever hurt someone knows the desperate need for mercy. These
experiences are real, immediate, and undeniable.

But as we explored justice and mercy more deeply, crucial questions
emerged: How do we know when justice is truly just and not merely
our own preference? How do we know when mercy is authentic healing
and not dangerous enablement? What prevents justice from becoming
revenge or mercy from becoming weakness?

The answer is truth.

      Justice without truth leads to tyranny and dehumaniza-
      tion. Mercy without truth leads to spiritual destruction.

Justice, Mercy and Truth are like three strands woven together into
one cord that is stronger than any of the individual strands. This
integration of truth, justice and mercy are palpable in Colossians 3:5-
17 which brings it all together in verse 14: “And over all these put on
love, that is, the bond of perfection.”

This is why truth serves as the sacred foundation that makes authentic
justice and mercy possible. We needed to experience our hunger for
justice and mercy first, so we could understand why truth is not
merely academic knowledge but the very foundation that prevents
these virtues from becoming distorted counterfeits.

                                                        Chapter 5 Truth


Without truth, we cannot know what justice truly requires or what
mercy genuinely heals. Truth is the sacred clarity that enables us
to love as God loves—perfectly integrating justice and mercy rather
than opposing them to each other. And this is why the Church has
always taught that we must seek truth not as isolated individuals,
but as members of the Body of Christ, guided by the authority Jesus
gave to His Church.


5.3     What Children Know About Truth
Children demonstrate pure understanding of truth before adults com-
plicate it with philosophical theories:

“That’s not what really happened!” Children have an instinc-
tive commitment to accuracy and know the difference between what
actually occurred and what someone claims occurred.

“You promised!” Children understand that words should match
reality and expect commitments to be truthful and reliable.

“But that doesn’t make sense!” Children recognize when expla-
nations contradict each other or don’t align with what they observe.

“Show me!” Children want evidence and are naturally empirical,
wanting to see and experience truth rather than accepting abstract
claims.

“I feel bad when I lie.” Children feel guilty when dishonest, and
when they confess with tears, they learn the joy of living in truth.

This childlike commitment to truth reflects our creation in God’s im-
age, who is Truth itself. Children haven’t yet learned to accept contra-
dictions as “sophisticated thinking” or to compromise with falsehood.


5.4     Why This Longing for Truth is Uni-
        versal: Made for Reality
The universal human hunger for truth isn’t accidental—it’s written
into our very nature because we are made in the image of God, who

                                  85
Chapter 5 Truth


is Truth itself. As Jesus declares: “I am the way, and the truth, and
the life” (John 14:6). God’s nature is perfectly truthful, and because
we bear His image, we are created to know, love, and live in truth.

The Catechism teaches us that “Man naturally tends toward truth.
He is obliged to honor and bear witness to it” (CCC 2467). This isn’t
merely a moral obligation imposed from outside—it flows from our
deepest nature as beings created for relationship with Truth Himself
and with each other.

Why We Suffer When Deceived: When we’re lied to, manipu-
lated, or fed false information, we experience genuine anguish. This
isn’t just disappointment—it’s the pain of being separated from our
natural environment. We are created to live in truth the way fish are
created to live in water. Deception is a form of spiritual suffocation.

Why We Rejoice in Discovery: There’s a unique joy that comes
from discovering truth—whether it’s a child learning how something
works, a student grasping a diﬀicult concept, or an adult finally under-
standing a relationship. This joy reflects our participation in God’s
own knowledge and our return to our natural element.

As we come to know God’s Truth of who he is and how His truths
teach us how to love, we are brought out of the darkness and into the
light. Read John 3:16–21.

      “But whoever lives the truth comes to the light, so that
      his works may be clearly seen as done in God.”

      John 3:21



5.5     The Nature of True Truth
Truth is not merely human opinion or cultural preference—it is the
conformity of mind to reality, and ultimately, participation in
God Himself. As the Catechism teaches: “God is truth itself, whose
words cannot deceive” (CCC 215). He reveals Himself to us through
interconnected ways that work together to give us the complete pic-
ture:

                                  86
                                                        Chapter 5 Truth


 Creation itself bears witness to God’s truth. As St. Paul teaches:
“Ever since the creation of the world his invisible nature, namely, his
eternal power and deity, has been clearly perceived in the things that
have been made” (Romans 1:20). The natural world, with its order
 and beauty, reveals God’s truth, wisdom and power.

The human heart, made in God’s image, naturally recognizes truth
through conscience and reason. Deep down, every person knows the
difference between what is real and what is false—between authentic
love and mere pretense, between genuine identity and deception, be-
tween actual relationships and empty words. This isn’t something we
learn from books; it’s written on our hearts by God Himself. Even
people who have never heard of Jesus often recognize His voice in
their conscience, calling them toward what is truly real rather than
what merely appears to be real.

Salvation History reveals God’s truth through His mighty acts
of love and redemption. From Abraham’s call to Christ’s resurrec-
tion, God has revealed His nature and plan through the progressive
covenants—with Noah, Abraham, Moses, and David—each building
toward the ultimate New Covenant in Jesus Christ. Through these
historical events and covenant relationships, God demonstrates His
faithfulness, justice, and mercy, culminating in Christ who is the full-
ness of divine revelation.

The Church, established by Christ Himself, serves as “the pillar and
foundation of the truth” (1 Timothy 3:15). Through the Magisterium
guided by the Holy Spirit, the Church authoritatively interprets Sa-
cred Scripture and thus creating a Sacred Tradition that helps us
understand the truth of God’s Perfect Love - and that the teachings
must be “true” - coherent, logical, consistent and “real” in a way that
matches reality and Scripture. The Church is the great “school of
love” which teaches the “science of love” or the “law of Christ” (Gala-
tians 6:2, Romans 7:25, Romans 8:2, Romans 10:4, 1 Corinthians
9:21).

Sacred Scripture contains God’s revealed truth given to us through
the prophets and apostles. The written Word of God provides the
definitive revelation of His nature and will for humanity. As Jesus

                                  87
Chapter 5 Truth


prayed to the Father: “Sanctify them in truth; your word is truth”
(John 17:17).

These five sources of truth—Creation, the human heart, Salvation
History, the Church, and Sacred Scripture—must be read and lived
together to ensure we have the complete truth of Christ. None stands
alone; each illuminates and confirms the others. This is why the
Catholic Church teaches that we need both Sacred Scripture and
Sacred Tradition, both faith and reason, both revelation and natural
law, and the authoritative guidance of the Church to fully understand
God’s truth. This is why it is said that the Catholic Faith is often
described as the “fullness of truth”.


Truth as Foundation for Love
Truth Enables Knowledge: We cannot truly love God or neigh-
bor without knowing them truthfully. Love requires seeing reality
clearly, not through illusions, projections, or wishful thinking. Most
fundamentally, authentic love requires knowing the truth about each
person’s inherent dignity as made in God’s image—we cannot truly
love someone whose true worth we deny or fail to recognize. A hus-
band who loves his wife based on false assumptions about who she
is doesn’t truly love her—he loves his fantasy. Similarly, we can-
not truly love someone we are deceiving, because deception creates a
barrier that prevents authentic relationship and communion.

     You cannot love what you do not know. Truth is the
     prerequisite for authentic love because love requires seeing
     the beloved as they truly are, not as we wish them to be.

Truth Guides Action: Truth provides the sacred clarity needed to
discern how to love correctly and justly. Love without truth can be
misguided or even harmful. The parent who refuses to discipline a
child out of false compassion enables destructive behavior. The friend
who aﬀirms sinful choices out of misguided kindness participates in
spiritual harm. When society undermines the dignity of the human
person, great tragedies will ensue (e.g. chattel slavery, abortion, eu-
thanasia, the Holocaust, etc.)

                                  88
                                                        Chapter 5 Truth


Truth Builds Trust: All authentic relationships—especially
covenant relationships—are built on trust, which requires truthful-
ness and integrity. Marriage vows spoken with mental reservations
aren’t true covenants. Friendships built on pretense or our own
selfish agenda aren’t authentic.

Truth Serves Justice: True justice requires acknowledging the
truth of situations and persons—what they are actually owed ac-
cording to their dignity and circumstances. Justice based on false
information or distorted understanding inevitably becomes injustice.

Truth Enables Mercy: True mercy involves acknowledging the
truth of sin in order to forgive it authentically. A half-confessed lie
cannot receive true absolution. Mercy that ignores the reality of
wrongdoing becomes mere enabling.

Truth Liberates Love: As Jesus promised, “You will know the
truth, and the truth will set you free” (John 8:32). Love grounded
in truth conforms itself to reality rather than demanding that reality
conform to our preferences, feelings, or desires. This liberates us
from the exhausting burden of trying to force the world to match our
illusions and enables us to love people as they actually are, not as we
wish they were.

As Pope Benedict XVI warned: “Without truth, charity degenerates
into sentimentality. Love becomes an empty shell, to be filled in an
arbitrary way. In a culture without truth, this is the fatal risk
facing love” (Caritas in Veritate, 3).


5.6     Truth requires Authority: The Foun-
        dation of Catholic Faith
Having established that mercy requires truth as its foundation, we
now face a crucial question: Who has the authority to determine
what truth actually is? The questions that arise in practicing mercy—
Should we forgive someone who shows no repentance? When does
“mercy” become enabling?—are not merely practical questions but
theological ones that require authoritative answers grounded in divine

                                  89
Chapter 5 Truth


revelation.

But here’s the profound insight: authority itself must come from
God because He is the Author of all reality. The very word
“authority” contains “author”—the one who creates, establishes, and
gives meaning to all that exists. Just as a novelist has authority over
the world she creates, God has absolute authority over the reality He
authored.

This isn’t about power or control—it’s about love freely received and
freely given. When we submit to God’s authority, we aren’t surrender-
ing to tyranny but humbly and voluntarily accepting the free
gift of His perfect love—what we call grace. If God’s truth were
dictated and forced upon us from above, it would indeed be tyranny.
But when we submit to His authority in freedom, we are choosing
to live according to the very design written into our nature by the
Author of life itself.

This voluntary submission is itself an act of love—choosing to align
our will with the will of the One who created us out of love and for
love. In this submission, we discover not slavery but freedom, not
oppression but the fullness of life that comes from living in harmony
with truth.


5.7     God’s Threefold Revelation of Truth
God has revealed truth to humanity through three complementary
sources:

Natural Law: Written in the human heart and discernible through
reason (Romans 2:14-15). This is why just about all cultures rec-
ognize basic moral truths like the wrongness of unjustified killing of
innocents, care for children, reciprocal fairness, in-group cooperation,
and respect for legitimate authority.

Creation: The visible world reveals God’s invisible attributes (Ro-
mans 1:20). The order, beauty, and complexity of creation point
to their Creator and teach us about His nature. Even nature has
objective truths that we recognize such as the laws of physics, the

                                  90
                                                        Chapter 5 Truth


constancy of gravity, the constancy of the speed of light, law of cause
and effect, etc.

Divine Revelation: God’s direct communication through Scrip-
ture and Tradition, preserved and interpreted by the Church’s Mag-
isterium.




5.8     Christ’s Grant of Authority to the
        Church
Jesus didn’t leave us to figure out truth individually. As the divine
Author incarnate, He established His Church as the authoritative
teacher and guardian of truth—not as an external imposition, but
as the continuation of His own loving authority:

“And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church,
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. I will give you the
keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall
be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed
in heaven” (Matthew 16:18-19).

The “keys” represent the authority to govern the Church and deter-
mine doctrine. “Binding and loosing” refers to the power to declare
what is forbidden or permitted, what is sinful or virtuous—in essence,
the authority to definitively interpret the Author’s truth for His crea-
tures.

“Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you rejects me;
but whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me” (Luke 10:16).

This authority is not arbitrary power but the loving guidance of the
Author ensuring His creatures can live according to their true design.
The Church’s teaching authority exists not to control but to liberate—
to free us from the slavery of error so we can live in the freedom of
truth.

                                  91
Chapter 5 Truth


5.9     The Church as “Pillar and Foundation
        of Truth”
St. Paul calls the Church “the pillar and foundation of the truth” (1
Timothy 3:15). This means:

The Magisterium: The Church has Jesus’ authority and respon-
sibility to teach the truth. As Jesus commanded: “All authority
in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore
and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe
all that I have commanded you” (Matthew 28:18-20). Most of us mis
including verse 18 when we refer to the great commission - but this
is Jesus granting authority to the Church to teach and baptize - to
carry out the “law of Christ”.

Infallibility: When the Church teaches definitively on matters of
faith and morals, she is protected from error by the Holy Spirit. As
Jesus promised: “When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you
into all the truth” (John 16:13). St. John reminds us: “We are from
God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does
not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of
error” (1 John 4:6).

 Apostolic Succession: The bishops are the successors of the apos-
 tles, maintaining an unbroken chain of authority from Christ Himself.
As St. Paul an Apostle instructed Timothy, the Bishop of Ephesus:
“What you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses en-
trust to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also” (2 Timothy
2:2). This is why every Priest takes a vow to teach the faith handed
 down from the apostles - not their own interpretation of the faith -
 but the deposit of faith as it has always been taught.

Unity of Teaching: Sacred Tradition maintains one faith across
all times, cultures, and circumstances, providing moral certainty in
a world of confusion and prevents future generations from distorting
the faith that has always been taught. As Paul urged: “I appeal to
you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you
agree, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united

                                  92
                                                        Chapter 5 Truth


in the same mind and the same judgment” (1 Corinthians 1:10).

     Jesus gave the Church His authority to teach the fullness
     of His Perfect Love.


5.10 Why Authority is Essential to Love
This isn’t about power or control—it’s about love protecting the vul-
nerable and guiding us to live a life of abundance in His truth, justice
and mercy.

Protects from Deception: Without authoritative teaching, people
fall prey to every wind of doctrine and cultural trend which will likely
lead us away from proper truth, justice and/or mercy.

Provides Moral Certainty: In complex ethical situations, we need
more than personal opinion—we need the wisdom of the Church.

Maintains Unity: Authority prevents the multiplication of contra-
dictory “truths” that divide the Body of Christ.

Ensures Fidelity: The Church’s authority keeps us faithful to
Christ’s original teaching rather than contemporary adaptations.

Enables Authentic Mercy: Only by knowing what sin actually is
can we offer true forgiveness and healing. Mercy that calls evil good
is not mercy but enabling.


5.11 How Catholics Can Share Truth with
     Others
Understanding Church authority doesn’t mean Catholics should be
arrogant or dismissive toward those who disagree. Instead, it gives us
confidence to engage in respectful dialogue:

Start with Natural Law: Begin conversations by appealing to
truths written on every human heart—truths that resonate across
cultures and beliefs. Start with what people already recognize: ev-
ery child deserves protection, honesty builds trust while deception
destroys it, and some actions are objectively wrong regardless of

                                  93
Chapter 5 Truth


circumstances—like the deliberate destruction of innocent life, the
enslavement of human beings, or the violation of another person’s
bodily integrity. These aren’t just Church teachings; they’re funda-
mental recognitions of human dignity that most people acknowledge,
even if they don’t yet see their full implications for truth, justice, and
mercy.

Share Personal Testimony: Explain how living according to
Catholic teaching has brought freedom, peace, and authentic love
into your life. Truth proves itself by its fruits.

Ask Good Questions: Instead of immediately asserting Church
teaching, ask questions that help people discover truth for themselves:
“What is love?”, “What do you think makes a marriage truly lasting?”,
“Does love require truth? justice? mercy?”, “How do we know when
we’re really loving someone versus just being nice?”

Show the Reasonableness of Faith: Demonstrate that Catholic
teaching makes sense not just because the Church says so, but because
it aligns with human experience, natural law, and the deepest longings
of the human heart.

Live with Integrity: The most powerful argument for Catholic
truth is a life that authentically reflects it. When people see Catholics
living with genuine joy, peace, and love, they become curious about
the source.



5.12      The Catholic Response to Rela-
          tivism
In our relativistic age, many people claim that “truth is subjective”
or “everyone has their own truth.” But this contradicts both reason
and revelation:

   • Truth is objective: Reality exists independently of our opin-
     ions about it
   • Truth is knowable: God created us with minds capable of
     knowing reality

                                   94
                                                        Chapter 5 Truth


   • Christ is “the Truth”: Jesus didn’t claim to have opinions—
     He claimed to be Truth itself. As He testified before Pilate:
    “For this purpose I was born and for this purpose I have come
     into the world—to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who
     belongs to the truth listens to my voice” (John 18:37).
   • To be “Catholic” means to submit: The word “catholic”
     means universal—we humbly submit to the Truth and Authority
     of Jesus as exercised through His Church so that we can most
     perfectly love God, neighbor, and self.

This submission isn’t intellectual slavery—it’s the joyful acceptance of
the Author’s design for His creation. When we submit to the Church’s
authority, we aren’t surrendering our freedom but discovering it. We
are choosing to live according to the very pattern written into our
nature by the One who knows us better than we know ourselves.

As Jesus promised: “If you continue in my word, you are truly my
disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free”
(John 8:31-32) and also “I came so that they might have life, and have
it more abundantly” (John 10:10).

In this voluntary submission to divine authority, we discover that
perfect love and perfect truth are not in tension but in harmony.
The Author’s authority is not the enemy of love—it is love’s very
foundation, ensuring that our love is grounded in reality rather than
illusion, in truth rather than deception.

But note that the “Word of God” referenced above - as the Author
of all reality - is found not only in the pages of Sacred Scripture, but
in the truth found in all of Creation, in the Human Heart, and in all
of the Church’s Teaching.


5.13 The Integration of Body, Mind, and
     Soul in Truth
Living in truth requires the harmonious integration of our entire hu-
man nature:

Body: The physical living out of truth through honest actions, au-

                                  95
Chapter 5 Truth


thentic behavior, and integrity between what we believe and how we
act. This includes speaking truthfully, acting with honesty in all our
dealings, and allowing our bodies to reflect the truth of the reality
of the world that God created. When we are living a lie, our bodies
physically feel this through stress, anxiety, and other physical symp-
toms.

Mind: The intellectual grasping of truth through reason, study, and
proper formation. This involves learning Church teaching, under-
standing the reasons for moral principles, and developing the ability
to distinguish truth from error. When we are living a lie, our minds
feel this through confusion, indecision, and other mental symptoms.

Soul: The spiritual embracing of truth as a participation in God
Himself, who is Truth. This is the deepest level where we recognize
that truth is not merely information but a Person—Jesus Christ who
said “I am the Truth.” When we are living a lie, our souls feel this
through a lack of peace, a sense of emptiness, and a desire for truth.

     When body, mind, and soul align in truth, we become
     living witnesses whose very lives proclaim the Gospel of
     God’s Perfect Love. When they are disordered, truth be-
     comes either cold intellectualism or empty emotionalism—
     counterfeits that repel rather than attract.

When these three work in harmony, we become witnesses to truth who
can convince others not just by arguments but by the authenticity of
our lives. When they are disordered, truth becomes mere intellectual-
ism, rigid legalism, or spiritual pride—counterfeits that repel rather
than attract.


5.14      Truth and the Sacraments
The sacraments are God’s way of making truth tangible and accessible
to our body-mind-soul unity:

Baptism washes away the lies of original sin and clothes us with the
truth of our identity as God’s children.

Confirmation gives us the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of Truth,

                                 96
                                                       Chapter 5 Truth


to guide us into all truth and give us courage to witness to truth.

Eucharist feeds us with Christ Himself, who is Truth incarnate,
transforming us into His likeness.

Reconciliation requires us to speak the truth about our sins and
receive the truth of God’s forgiveness.

Marriage calls spouses to live in complete honesty and fidelity, imag-
ing God’s faithful love.

Holy Orders ordains men to teach and defend the truth as shepherds
of the flock.

Anointing of the Sick helps us face the truth of our mortality while
trusting in the truth of eternal life.


5.15 The Mass: The School of Truth and
     Wisdom
The Mass serves as the primary means where Catholics grow in and
actually encounter the truth of God’s Perfect Love. This is something
that modern Christianity has largely abandoned, but it remains cen-
tral to authentic Catholic life:

The Liturgy of the Word systematically presents God’s truth
through Scripture readings that follow the liturgical calendar. Over
three years, Catholics hear the essential truths of salvation history,
not according to personal preference of the pastor or popular topics,
but according to the Church’s wisdom about what we need to hear.

The Homily is not entertainment or motivational speaking, but the
priest’s sacred duty to break open God’s Word and show how divine
truth applies to our daily lives. Through the homily, we learn how
God enacts justice and mercy so that we can love better.

The Liturgical Calendar ensures that we encounter the full scope
of divine truth—the Incarnation, Passion, Resurrection, and the lives
of saints who embodied truth. We don’t choose which truths are
convenient; we submit to the Church’s wisdom about which truths

                                 97
Chapter 5 Truth


we need to hear when.

The Unity of Word and Sacrament means that the truth we hear
is immediately made present in the Eucharist. We don’t just learn
about Christ’s love; we receive Christ Himself. Truth becomes not
just intellectual knowledge but transformative encounter.

Wisdom Over Information: This approach cultivates true
wisdom—the integration of knowledge, understanding, and right
living—rather than mere information. Modern Christianity often
focuses on emotional experiences or practical tips, but the Mass
forms us in the deep wisdom that enables us to love as God loves.

Community Formation: The Mass forms us together as the Body
of Christ, not as isolated individuals. We learn truth in communion
with others, guided by legitimate authority, rooted in tradition, and
ordered toward our ultimate destiny.

This is why faithful Catholics who attend Mass regularly develop a
deep, integrated understanding of how truth, justice, and mercy work
together in authentic love. The Mass doesn’t just teach us about these
virtues—it forms us to live them.


5.16      The Sacrifice Truth Demands
Living in truth often requires genuine sacrifice:

Personal Humility: Truth sometimes reveals uncomfortable reali-
ties about ourselves that our pride wants to deny. Accepting these
truths requires the humility to admit our faults and limitations.

Confronting Others: Love sometimes demands that we speak diﬀi-
cult truths to those we care about. This requires the courage to risk
relationships for the sake of authentic good.

Social Opposition: Standing for moral truth in a relativistic cul-
ture often brings ridicule, persecution, or professional consequences.
Truth-telling can be costly. Just ask the earliest saints of the Church
including the Disciples and the martyrs who literally paid the ulti-
mate price for loving Jesus.

                                  98
                                                         Chapter 5 Truth


Intellectual Effort: Seeking truth requires the discipline of study,
reflection, and formation. It’s easier to accept popular opinions than
to do the hard work of understanding reality.

Spiritual Submission: Accepting the Church’s teaching authority
requires setting aside our personal preferences and submitting to wis-
dom greater than our own.

      Truth without love becomes harsh judgment. Love with-
      out truth becomes dangerous sentiment. Only in the per-
      fect harmony of both do we find authentic Catholic wit-
      ness.

As St. Edith Stein (Teresa Benedicta of the Cross) taught: “Do not
accept anything as the truth if it lacks love. And do not accept anything
as love which lacks truth.”


5.17 How Truth Serves Perfect Love
Truth is not the enemy of love—it is love’s essential foundation. Our
comprehensive definition reveals this clearly: “Perfect love is the sa-
cred, sacrificial gift of covenant, binding truth, justice, and mercy,
gathering us into life-giving communion.”

Sacred Truth: Love must be grounded in the objective, sacred truth
revealed by God. This provides the sacred clarity that prevents love
from becoming mere sentiment or wishful thinking.

Sacrifice: Upholding truth often demands sacrifice, but this sacrifice
serves authentic love by protecting relationships from the corrosion
of deception.

Covenant: Sacred covenants must be based on truthful com-
mitments. Marriage vows spoken without honesty become empty
promises rather than sacred bonds.

Binds: Truth binds love to reality, preventing the distortion that
turns love into manipulation, enabling, or self-deception.

True Justice/Mercy: Both justice and mercy depend fundamen-
tally on acknowledging and acting according to truth. False justice

                                   99
Chapter 5 Truth


punishes the innocent; false mercy enables evil.

     Truth is not the enemy of love—it is love’s sacred founda-
     tion. Without truth, justice becomes tyranny and mercy
     becomes enablement. With truth, both become perfect
     expressions of divine love.

Life-Giving Communion: Authentic communion requires mutual
understanding and trust, fostered by living in truth. We cannot live
in “communion” with ourselves, our neighbors or God if we are living
in deception and causing division in the Body of Christ.


5.18      What Evils Truth Overcomes
Truth combats the fundamental evil of deception that corrupts rela-
tionships, destroys trust, and enables all other forms of moral evil.
When truth is abandoned:

  • Justice becomes impossible because we can’t determine what
    people actually deserve
  • Mercy becomes meaningless because we can’t identify what
    needs forgiveness
  • Relationships are built on false foundations that inevitably col-
    lapse
  • Society loses the common understanding necessary for authentic
    community
  • The vulnerable are exploited by those who manipulate truth for
    personal gain

Lies create the darkness in which evil flourishes. Truth is the light
that exposes evil and makes authentic love possible.


5.19      Living the Response
Daily Examination: Each evening, ask yourself: “Have I been
truthful in my words and actions today? Have I sought truth in my
decisions? Have I accepted diﬀicult truths about myself and others?”

Study and Formation: Commit to regular study of Church teach-

                                 100
                                                         Chapter 5 Truth


ing through the Sacred Scripture, the Catechism, papal encyclicals,
and authentic Catholic sources. Truth requires formation, not just
good intentions. As St. Paul teaches: “All Scripture is breathed out
by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and
for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete,
equipped for every good work” (2 Timothy 3:16-17). That “every good
work” is fundamentally about loving as Jesus calls us to love—for righ-
teousness is right relationship with God, which is unlocked when we
know how to love Him and our neighbor properly.

 Honest Relationships: Practice speaking truthfully in love, even
when it’s diﬀicult. This means both avoiding lies and having the
 courage to address problems directly. St. Paul instructs us to be
“speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him
who is the head, into Christ” (Ephesians 4:15).

Submission to Authority: Embrace the Church’s teaching author-
ity as a gift that protects you from error and guides you toward
authentic love.

Witness by Example: Let your life be a testimony to truth by
maintaining integrity between your beliefs and your actions.

Heavenly Father, You are Truth itself, and in Your Son Jesus we see
truth perfectly revealed. Grant us the humility to accept diﬀicult truths
about ourselves, the courage to live truthfully in love to others, and
the wisdom to submit to the authority You have established in Your
Church. Help us to live in the sacred clarity that comes from knowing
You, who are the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Through the same
Christ our Lord. Amen.



5.20 Daily Examen: Truth
Evening Reflection: 1. Gratitude: What truths did I discover
or appreciate today? 2. Examination: Where did I compromise
with deception or avoid diﬀicult truths? 3. Sorrow: How did my
failures in truthfulness harm my relationships or spiritual life? 4.
Resolution: What specific truth do I need to embrace or speak

                                  101
Chapter 5 Truth


tomorrow? 5. Prayer: Ask for the grace to live in sacred clarity and
speak truth in love.

Daily Practice: Before making important decisions, ask: “What
does the truth of this situation require?” Let truth guide your choices
rather than convenience, preference, or fear.

Act of Contrition: “O my God, I am heartily sorry for having of-
fended You, and I detest all my sins because of Your just punishments,
but most of all because they offend You, my God, who are all-good
and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of Your
grace, to sin no more and to avoid the near occasions of sin. Amen.”

Sacrifice

      “Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down
      his life for his friends.”

      John 15:13

      “I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of
      God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and
      acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.”

      Romans 12:1

      “Love is proved by deeds, not by words.”

      St. Ignatius of Loyola




6.1     The Moment Love Becomes Real
“Take my life instead.”

These four words reveal the deepest mystery of love—that authen-
tic love is willing to give everything, even life itself, for the beloved.
Whether spoken by a parent shielding their child from danger, a sol-
dier protecting his comrades, or Christ offering Himself on the cross,
sacrifice is the moment when love proves itself willing to pay any price.

                                  103
Chapter 6 Sacrifice


In our journey through the essential facets of authentic love, we have
seen how truth provides the foundation (Chapter 2), justice estab-
lishes what we owe each person (Chapter 3), and mercy chooses to
give even more than justice requires (Chapter 4). But knowledge
alone, even perfect knowledge of truth, justice, and mercy, is not
enough. We can understand what love requires and still fail to act on
that knowledge. We can grasp justice and mercy perfectly and still
choose selfishness over service.

This is why sacrifice stands at the very heart of authentic love. Sacri-
fice transforms the other virtues from ideas into actions, from knowl-
edge into life. Sacrifice is love made visible—the moment when we
prove that we value the beloved more than ourselves, that their good
matters more than our comfort, that their flourishing is worth our
cost. Without sacrifice, love remains merely theoretical. With sacri-
fice, love becomes transformative.

As we will see, sacrifice is not about losing ourselves or diminishing
our dignity. Rather, true sacrifice is about discovering our deepest
identity through self-giving, finding our greatest joy through service,
and participating in the very nature of God, who is perfect self-giving
love.

      Every act of love requires sacrifice. Sacrifice transforms
      love from theory into reality.


6.2      What Children Know About Sacrifice
Children demonstrate pure understanding of sacrifice before adults
complicate it with theories about self-actualization:

They want to help mom and dad. Children constantly offer to
help with whatever their parents are doing—not because someone
told them to, but because helping those they love feels natural and
good.

They give up their turn. Children will let a younger sibling go first
on the slide or choose the game, understanding that love sometimes
means waiting.

                                 104
                                                        Chapter 6 Sacrifice


They give up their plans. Children will change their game or
activity to include a friend who wants to play, sacrificing their original
idea for the joy of shared play.

They share with those who don’t have. Children will break their
cookie in half to give some to a friend who has none, understanding
that love means no one should be left out.

They protect without thinking. An older child will stand between
a younger sibling and something scary, their own fear forgotten in
their desire to keep someone safe.

Children sacrifice naturally, without thinking of it as sacrifice. Their
love simply overflows into action, unburdened by adult calculations
of cost or reward.


6.3     Why This Call to Sacrifice is Univer-
        sal: Made in God’s Image
The universal human capacity for sacrifice isn’t accidental—it’s writ-
ten into our very nature because we are made in the image of God,
who is perfect self-giving love. The Trinity itself is the eternal model
of sacrifice:

The Father eternally gives Himself completely to the Son, hold-
ing nothing back in perfect self-donation. In time, He sacrifices His
beloved Son for our salvation, giving what is most precious to Him
for the sake of those who had rejected Him. “For God so loved the
world that he gave his only Son” (John 3:16).

The Son eternally receives everything from the Father and gives
everything back in perfect reciprocal love. In time, He sacrifices His
life, willingly laying it down and taking it up again, choosing the
Cross not from compulsion but from love. “This is why the Father
loves me, because I lay down my life in order to take it up again. No
one takes it from me, but I lay it down on my own.” (John 10:18).

The Holy Spirit eternally proceeds from the Father and Son as
their mutual love, sacrificing His own glory to point always to the Son,

                                   105
Chapter 6 Sacrifice


never to Himself. In time, He works tirelessly for our sanctification
while remaining hidden, inspiring our sacrifices and uniting them with
Christ’s perfect offering.

      The Trinity is the eternal model of perfect self-giving love.

This divine pattern of self-giving love becomes the model for all au-
thentic human love. As St. Paul writes: “Present your bodies as a
living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual
worship” (Romans 12:1). We are called to participate in God’s own
nature through sacrifice.

Because we bear God’s image, we find our deepest fulfillment not
in getting but in giving, not in being served but in serving, not in
accumulating but in offering. This is why sacrifice produces joy rather
than misery, freedom rather than bondage, life rather than death.
The call to sacrifice written in every human heart points us toward
our true calling as children of God.


6.4      The Nature of Sacrifice: Love Made
         Visible
Sacrifice is not merely giving up something good for something
better—it is the concrete expression of love. When we sacrifice,
we demonstrate that we value the beloved more than ourselves, that
their good matters more than our comfort, that their flourishing is
worth our cost.

The Fundamental Choice: Sin vs. Love

At its core, the difference between sin and love can be understood
through sacrifice:

Sin is doing something for our own good at the expense of others.
Sin always involves taking—taking pleasure, taking advantage, taking
what belongs to another, taking the easy path that harms someone
else. Sin is fundamentally selfish, seeking our benefit regardless of the
cost to others.

Love is doing something good for the other at our own expense. Love

                                  106
                                                       Chapter 6 Sacrifice


always involves giving—giving time, giving comfort, giving resources,
giving up our preferences for another’s good. Love is fundamentally
sacrificial, seeking the other’s benefit regardless of the cost to our-
selves.

Sacrifice Engages Body, Mind, and Soul:

Body: Physical acts of sacrifice—fasting, almsgiving, serving oth-
ers, enduring hardship for love, offering our physical strength and re-
sources for the good of others. The body participates in love through
concrete acts of self-denial and service.

Mind: Intellectual sacrifice—surrendering our pride of opinion,
studying truth rather than seeking to be right, choosing wisdom over
cleverness, sacrificing our desire to control through knowledge. The
mind participates in love by seeking truth for the sake of the beloved
rather than for personal pride or glory.

Soul: Spiritual sacrifice—surrendering our will to God’s will, choos-
ing virtue over vice, offering our sufferings for the salvation of others,
dying to self that Christ might live in us. The soul participates in
love by making the fundamental choice of God over self.

This integration of body, mind, and soul in sacrifice reflects our nature
as unified beings created for love. Authentic sacrifice engages the
whole person—our physical body, our intellect, and our will—in the
act of love.


6.5     How Sacrifice Integrates Truth, Jus-
        tice, and Mercy
Sacrifice transforms the other essential facets of authentic love from
ideas into lived reality:

Sacrifice Makes Truth Effective: We can know the truth about
what love requires, but without sacrifice, that truth remains merely
intellectual. When we sacrifice our pride to admit we were wrong,
sacrifice our comfort to seek truth in prayer and study, or sacrifice
our popularity to speak truth in love, we make truth effective in our

                                  107
Chapter 6 Sacrifice


relationships and in the world.

Sacrifice Makes Justice Effective: Justice requires giving each
person their due, but this often costs us something. We sacrifice
our time to serve others, our resources to help those in need, our
preferences to honor our commitments. Without sacrifice, justice
becomes mere theory. With sacrifice, justice becomes love in action.

Sacrifice Makes Mercy Effective: Mercy chooses to forgive rather
than punish, to heal rather than harm, but this choice always requires
sacrifice. We sacrifice our desire for revenge, our wounded pride, our
right to “get even.” Without sacrifice, mercy remains a nice sentiment.
With sacrifice, mercy becomes the transformative power that breaks
cycles of hurt.

The Integration: Truth tells us what love requires, justice estab-
lishes what we owe each person according to their dignity, mercy
chooses to give more than justice requires, and sacrifice provides the
power to actually live truth, justice, and mercy rather than merely
understanding them.

To live this out means understanding this integration via our intellect
and directing our will to actually make the sacrifice.

      “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the
      kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of
      my Father who is in heaven.”

      Matthew 7:21


6.6      The Biblical Foundation:                          Jewish
         Types of Sacrifice
While many Christians today hear “sacrifice” and think only of Jesus’
death on the Cross, the Old Testament sacrificial system reveals the
essential nature of sacrifice and prepares us to understand Christ’s
perfect sacrifice. Each type of offering teaches us something crucial
about how sacrifice makes love visible and effective.

1.   The Burnt Offering (Olah - “That Which Goes Up”)

                                  108
                                                      Chapter 6 Sacrifice


This was the most complete sacrifice, where the entire animal was
consumed by fire, symbolizing total self-offering to God. Leviticus 1:9
describes it as “a burnt offering, a food offering with a pleasing aroma
to the Lord.” The burnt offering represents the oblative (sacrifice that
goes up) dimension of sacrifice—pure love that holds nothing back. It
prefigures Christ’s complete self-offering on the Cross and calls us to
offer ourselves entirely to God, as St. Paul writes: “Present your
bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God” (Romans
12:1).

2. The Sin Offering (Chatat - “Purification”) This sacrifice
made atonement for unintentional sins and ritual impurities. The high
priest would lay his hands on the animal, symbolically transferring
the people’s sins to the victim (Leviticus 4:20). This offering reveals
the expiatory dimension of sacrifice—how it makes reparation for sin
and restores right relationship with God. It directly prefigures Christ
as “the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world” (John
1:29) and teaches us that our sacrifices, united with His, can make
reparation for sin.

3. The Guilt Offering (Asham - “Compensation”) This sac-
rifice was required when someone had wronged another person or
violated sacred property, and it included both the sacrifice and ma-
terial restitution (Leviticus 5:14-6:7). The guilt offering shows that
authentic sacrifice must address both the vertical relationship with
God and the horizontal relationships with neighbors. It teaches us
that love requires both justice and mercy—making things right while
restoring relationship.

4. The Peace Offering (Shelamim - “Wholeness/Completion”)
Unlike other sacrifices, portions of the peace offering were eaten by
the offerer and their family in a sacred meal before God (Leviticus
7:11-21). This sacrifice celebrated communion with God and neigh-
bor, expressing gratitude, fulfilling vows, or simply offering freewill
worship. It prefigures the Eucharist, where Christ’s sacrifice becomes
our food and creates communion between God and humanity. The
peace offering teaches us that sacrifice’s ultimate purpose is not
destruction but communion—bringing us into deeper unity with God

                                  109
Chapter 6 Sacrifice


and each other.

5. The Grain Offering (Minchah - “Gift”) This bloodless offer-
ing of fine flour, oil, and frankincense represented the fruit of human
labor offered to God (Leviticus 2:1-16). It shows that sacrifice in-
cludes not just dramatic moments of suffering but the daily offering
of our work, creativity, and ordinary efforts. Every honest day’s work,
when offered to God, becomes a sacrifice that expresses love.

6. The Thanksgiving Offering (Todah - “Praise/Gratitude”)
A special type of peace offering, the thanksgiving sacrifice was offered
specifically to acknowledge God’s goodness and deliverance (Leviticus
7:12-15). Unlike other peace offerings, the thanksgiving sacrifice had
to be eaten the same day it was offered, emphasizing the immediacy
and intensity of gratitude. Psalm 50:14 commands: “Offer to God a
sacrifice of thanksgiving, and perform your vows to the Most High.”
This sacrifice teaches us that gratitude itself is a form of sacrifice—
recognizing that every good gift comes from God and offering our
praise as a return gift. It prefigures the Eucharist most directly, as
“Eucharist” literally means “thanksgiving,” in Greek and shows how
our grateful hearts become living sacrifices of praise.

The Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) The annual Day of Atone-
ment (Leviticus 16) combined multiple sacrifices in the most solemn
ritual of the Jewish year. The high priest would sacrifice a bull for his
own sins, then cast lots over two goats—one to be sacrificed and one
to be sent into the wilderness bearing the people’s sins. This ritual
reveals both dimensions of Christ’s sacrifice: He is both the perfect
priest who offers and the perfect victim who is offered, both the one
who makes atonement and the one who bears our sins away.

The Two Essential Dimensions of All Sacrifice: Every authentic
sacrifice—from the Jewish offerings to Christ’s Cross to our daily
offerings—has two essential dimensions that work together:

1. Expiation (Justice): Sacrifice makes reparation for sin and
restores right relationship with God. This is not merely symbolic—
it accomplishes real spiritual work in the order of justice. The Old
Testament established the principle that sacrifice makes reparation

                                  110
                                                     Chapter 6 Sacrifice


for sin and restores right relationship with God. This is not merely
symbolic—it accomplishes real spiritual work in the order of justice.

      According to the law almost everything is purified by
      blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no
      forgiveness.

      Hebrews 9:22

Christ’s sacrifice accomplished what animal sacrifices could only sym-
bolize: “When Christ appeared as a high priest… he entered once
for all into the Holy Place, taking not the blood of goats and calves
but his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption” (Hebrews
9:11-12).

2. Oblation (Mercy): Sacrifice is also a free gift of love that goes
beyond what justice requires. Even if we had never sinned, love would
still call us to sacrifice for the beloved because love naturally gives
itself away. Christ taught: “Greater love has no man than this, that a
man lay down his life for his friends” (John 15:13). God’s love moved
Him to sacrifice even before we deserved it: “But God shows his love
for us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us” (Romans
5:8).



6.7     What This Teaches Us About Sacri-
        fice
The Jewish sacrificial system reveals that authentic sacrifice is not
arbitrary suffering but purposeful communal acts of giving that ac-
complishes specific spiritual work. Our daily sacrifices participate in
and unite with Christ’s perfect sacrifice when they express total self-
offering (burnt offering), make reparation for sin (sin offering), seek
to make amends for wrongs (guilt offering), build communion with
God and neighbor (peace offering), offer our ordinary work and life
to God (grain offering), and transform our gratitude into worship
(thanksgiving offering).

                                 111
Chapter 6 Sacrifice


6.8      How These Prefigure Christ’s Perfect
         Sacrifice
Each Jewish sacrifice was a shadow pointing to the reality of Christ’s
Cross. As the Letter to the Hebrews explains: “It is impossible for
the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins” (Hebrews 10:4), but
“when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat
down at the right hand of God” (Hebrews 10:12). Christ’s sacrifice
fulfills and perfects all sacrifices simultaneously. One of the many
ways Jesus came to fulfill the Law:

      “Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the
      prophets. I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.”

      Matthew 5:17

   • His burnt offering is the most complete self-giving to the Fa-
     ther (gift)
   • His sin offering is the sacrifice that takes away the sin of the
     world (mercy)
   • His guilt offering is the sacrifice that makes restitution for our
     debt to divine justice (justice)
   • His peace offering is the sacrifice that creates communion be-
     tween God and humanity (life giving communion)
   • His grain offering is the sacrifice that offers His human life
     and work to the Father (sacrifice)
   • His thanksgiving offering is the perfect Eucharist that trans-
     forms our gratitude into worship (participation)

Jesus fulfills the law by offering Himself as the perfect sacrifice—
making reparation for our sins while offering pure love to the Father.
Through His sacrifice, He not only saves us but invites us to unite our
own sacrifices with His, sharing in His redemptive love for the world.

Every Mass makes present both dimensions of Christ’s sacrifice—
expiatory (making reparation for sins) and oblative (offering pure
love to the Father)—and draws us into communion with this perfect
offering.

6.9     The Paschal Mystery: Death and
        Resurrection as One Perfect Sacrifice
Christ’s sacrifice is not merely His death on the Cross—it is the com-
plete Paschal Mystery of His passion, death, and resurrection work-
ing together as one perfect sacrifice. This is crucial for understanding
authentic love:

The Death: Christ’s death on the Cross accomplishes the expiatory
dimension of sacrifice—making reparation for sin, satisfying divine
justice, and opening the gates of heaven. As St. Paul writes: “He was
delivered up for our trespasses” (Romans 4:25a). The Cross shows us
that authentic love is willing to suffer and even die for the beloved.

The Resurrection: Christ’s resurrection accomplishes the oblative
dimension of sacrifice—demonstrating that love is stronger than
death, that self-giving leads to new life, and that sacrifice produces
joy rather than mere loss. St. Paul continues: “and raised for our
justification” (Romans 4:25b). The Resurrection shows us that
authentic sacrifice leads not to destruction but to transformation.

The Unity: Death and resurrection together reveal that authentic
sacrifice always involves both dying to self and rising to new life. We
cannot have one without the other. Every act of sacrificial love re-
quires us to “die” to our selfishness and “rise” to a greater capacity for
love. This is why St. Paul can say: “I have been crucified with Christ.
It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me” (Galatians
2:20).

The Eucharist teaches us that sacrifice is not about destruction but
transformation, not about loss but about love, not about death but
about life. In the Mass, we re-live Christ’s sacrifice and through
this, learn to offer ourselves as Christ offered Himself—completely,
willingly, and lovingly.

      The Eucharist - or Holy Communion - is the living lesson
      in sacrifice, where we learn to love by uniting our body,
      mind, and soul to Christ’s sacrifice.

6.10       Mary: The Perfect Model of Sacrifi-
           cial Love

After Christ, Mary provides a most perfect example of sacrificial love.
Her entire life was a continuous “fiat”—a willing surrender to God’s
will - the sacrifice of a mother - that began at the Annunciation and
culminated at the Cross.


Her Fiat at the Annunciation: Mary’s “Let it be done unto me ac-
cording to your word” (Luke 1:38) was a most fundamental sacrifice—
the sacrifice of her own will, her plans, her reputation, and her safety
for the sake of God’s plan of salvation. This sacrifice made the Incar-
nation possible and shows us that the greatest sacrifices often involve
surrendering our limited human understanding to God’s infinite wis-
dom and plan.


Her Presence at the Cross: While the apostles fled, Mary stood
at the foot of the Cross, offering her maternal heart in union with her
Son’s sacrifice. She sacrificed her natural desire to protect her child,
instead offering Him with perfect love for our salvation. As Simeon
prophesied, “a sword will pierce your own soul also” (Luke 2:35). Her
presence there was not passive but active participation in the work of
redemption as we are called to be.


Her Ongoing Intercession: Mary continues to sacrifice for us, in-
terceding constantly before the throne of God, offering her prayers
and love for our salvation. Her maternal heart cannot rest while any
of her children remain in danger of eternal loss.


Model for All Christians: Mary shows us that perfect sacrifice is
always united with perfect trust. She teaches us to say “yes” to God’s
will even when we cannot understand it, to remain faithful even in
the darkest hours, and to unite our sufferings with Christ’s for the
salvation of others.

6.11 Our Participation in Christ’s Sacri-
     fice
Eucharistic Participation: In the Mass, we bring all our daily
sacrifices to the altar to be united with Christ’s perfect sacrifice and
participate in His sacrifice for us, so that we may be transformed into
the likeness of Christ be His sacrifice in the world.

In the Confiteor (I confess to almighty God), we offer our failures
and need for mercy as a sacrifice of humility. During the Kyrie
(Lord have mercy), we state our dependece and trust in God’s mercy
through the Lord and Christ.

In the Gloria (Glory to God in the Highest) and Sanctus (Holy,
Holy, Holy Lord), we offer our praise and worship, joining the angels
in adoration.

During the Preparation of the Gifts, we offer our works, sufferings,
and prayers along with the bread and wine. At the Consecration,
these offerings are transformed and united with Christ’s Body and
Blood.

In the Agnus Dei (Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the
world), we offer our trust in Christ’s Mercy as the Lamb of God who
takes away the sins of the world and in granting mercy is the source
of granting us peace.

The most intense moment of worship in the Mass comes when the
priest holds up the consecrated Host and Chalice, declaring with John
the Baptist: “Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away
the sins of the world. Blessed are those called to the supper of the
Lamb.” This is the moment when heaven touches earth, when Christ’s
sacrifice is made present before us in all its power and glory.

Our response to this supreme revelation is the “Domine, non sum
dignus” prayer - “Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under
my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.” In this
moment, we acknowledge our complete faith, trust and dependence
on Christ’s mercy and our unworthiness to receive so great a gift. We
recognize our place in the order of love - not as those who deserve such

                                  115
Chapter 6 Sacrifice


grace, but as those who receive it purely through Christ’s sacrificial
love.

This prayer echoes the profound faith of the Roman centurion in
Matthew 8:5-13. The centurion came to Jesus asking for healing for
his servant who was paralyzed and suffering terribly. When Jesus
offered to come and heal him, the centurion responded with the same
humility and trust we express in our Communion prayer:

      Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof;
      but only say the word, and my servant will be healed.

      Matthew 8:8

The centurion understood authority—he was a man under authority
with soldiers under him. He recognized that Jesus had absolute au-
thority over sickness and death, needing only to speak for healing to
occur. Jesus was amazed by this faith and declared:

      Truly, I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such
      faith.

      Matthew 8:10b

This story teaches us that approaching Christ’s Sacrifice in the Eu-
charist requires the same humble recognition of His authority and our
unworthiness, combined with absolute trust in His power to heal and
transform us through His word alone.

When we approach the altar to receive Holy Communion, we do
not merely “receive” something—we are transformed by divine
fire. The God who spoke the universe into existence makes Him-
self our food and drink. The eternal Word through whom all things
were made enters our bodies, our souls, our very being. We become
what we receive—the Body of Christ becomes our body, His Blood
flows through our veins. We are mystically crucified with Christ,
buried with Him in baptism, and raised with Him in glory. His sacri-
fice becomes our sacrifice, His love becomes our love, His life becomes
our life.

In this moment of supreme intimacy, the infinite God who created
galaxies and holds atoms together makes His dwelling within us. The

                                 116
                                                     Chapter 6 Sacrifice


same power that raised Christ from the dead now courses through
our mortal bodies. We are consumed by Love Himself and made
into living tabernacles of His presence. This is not merely grace
received—it is divine life exchanged, eternal love enfleshed,
heaven breaking into earth within the sanctuary of our souls.

     The Eucharist transforms us into living sacrifices
     animated by divine love.

At the Dismissal, we are not merely sent—we are commissioned
as Christ-bearers, living sacrifices animated by divine love,
carrying the fire of the altar into a world dying for want of authentic
love.

St. Paul explains this profound reality:

     The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation
     in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not
     a participation in the body of Christ?

     1 Corinthians 10:16-17

The Mass is not merely a memorial of Christ’s sacrifice—it is the
mystical participation in the very sacrifice that conquered evil it-
self. Here, the eternal expiation of divine justice and the perfect
oblation of divine mercy become present and active in our midst.

In this sacred liturgy, we do not simply remember Christ’s sacrifice—
we enter into it. The same infinite satisfaction that paid the debt
of sin for all humanity becomes our own offering. The same perfect
gift of self-giving love that reconciled heaven and earth becomes our
own oblation. Through the Eucharist, we are drawn into the mys-
tical communion of Christ’s Body, where our daily sacrifices—our
sufferings, our works, our prayers—are united to His infinite merits
and given supernatural eﬀicacy for the salvation of souls.

This participation transforms us from the inside out. As we consume
the Bread of Life and drink from the Cup of Salvation, we be-
come what we receive—living sacrifices animated by divine love. Jesus
Himself declares this mystery:

     I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if

                                 117
Chapter 6 Sacrifice


      any one eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and the
      bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my
      flesh… Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh
      of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in
      you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal
      life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is
      food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He who eats
      my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him.

      John 6:51-56

The Mass teaches us that authentic sacrifice is never merely human
effort, but always participation in Christ’s perfect love—a love
that simultaneously satisfies divine justice and overflows with divine
mercy. Here we learn that true sacrifice is not loss but gain, not death
but life, not defeat but victory over every form of evil.

      He said, “The Son of Man must suffer greatly and be
      rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes,
      and be killed and on the third day be raised.” Then he said
      to all, “If anyone wishes to come after me, he must deny
      himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For
      whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever
      loses his life for my sake will save it.

      Luke 9:22-24

Mystical Participation: St. Paul reveals another dimension of how
our sacrifices can participate in Christ’s redemptive work: “Now I
rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I complete what
is lacking in Christ’s afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the
church” (Colossians 1:24). This doesn’t mean Christ’s sacrifice was
insuﬀicient, but that He invites us to unite our daily sufferings and
sacrifices with His for the salvation of souls. As members of Christ’s
Mystical Body, our suffering and sacrifices have infinite value when
united with His.

When we unite our sacrifices with Christ’s, we don’t just avoid sin;
we flood the world with the opposite of sin. Where sin destroys rela-
tionships through selfishness, our sacrificial love builds relationships

                                  118
                                                      Chapter 6 Sacrifice


through generous service. Where sin dishonors God and neighbor
through injustice, our sacrifices restore honor through acts of justice
that give each person their due dignity. Where sin wounds and di-
vides through hardness of heart, our sacrifices heal and unite through
mercy that chooses to forgive and restore rather than condemn and
reject.


6.12 How Sacrifice Transforms the Heart
From Self-Seeking to Self-Giving: Sacrifice breaks the fundamen-
tal pattern of sin, which is always about taking rather than giving,
grasping rather than releasing, serving self rather than serving others.
Each act of sacrifice rewires the heart toward love.

From Fear to Freedom: Paradoxically, sacrifice liberates us from
the fear of loss. When we freely give away what we might lose anyway,
we discover that our true treasure is not in what we possess but in
whom we love. “Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also”
(Matthew 6:21).

From Isolation to Communion: Sacrifice creates covenantal
bonds that unite us with others. When we sacrifice for someone,
we become invested in their good. When someone sacrifices for
us, we experience the reality of being loved. These bonds create
the communion that is love’s ultimate goal. Conversely, when we
avoid sacrifice, we isolate ourselves from the “community” (note that
communion and community share the same root word in latin, “unio”
which is the state of being “one” or “whole”).

From Temporal to Eternal: Sacrifice teaches us to value eternal
goods over temporal ones, spiritual riches over material wealth, the
soul’s welfare over the body’s comfort. It reorders our priorities ac-
cording to their true importance.


6.13 The Fruits of Sacrificial Love
Joy: “It is more blessed to give than to receive” (Acts 20:35). Sacri-
fice produces a deep joy that comes from participating in God’s own

                                 119
Chapter 6 Sacrifice


nature, which is self-giving love. This joy is different from pleasure—
it can coexist with pain and diﬀiculty.

Peace: Sacrifice brings peace because it aligns our will with God’s
will and our heart with love’s demands. The person who sacrifices
for truth, justice and mercy experiences the peace that comes from
living according to our deepest nature.

Strength: Each act of sacrifice strengthens our capacity for greater
sacrifice. Like physical exercise, spiritual exercise builds spiritual mus-
cle. The saints could make heroic sacrifices because they had prac-
ticed with smaller ones.

Wisdom: Sacrifice teaches us what truly matters. When we give
up lesser goods for greater ones, we learn to distinguish between the
essential and the accidental, the eternal and the temporal. For ex-
ample, your sacrifice of time to read this book, read Scripture, go
to Mass and truly absorbing it and living it will create a more deep
union with God’s perfect love.

Greater Capacity for Love: Most importantly, sacrifice increases
our ability to love. The more we give, the more we can give. The
heart that sacrifices becomes a heart capable of ever-greater love.


6.14       The Eucharist: The Perfect School
           of Sacrifice
The Mass is the perfect school of sacrifice because it makes present
the perfect sacrifice of Christ. At every Mass:

We offer our gifts (bread and wine representing our work and our
lives) to be transformed into Christ’s Body and Blood.

We offer our thanksgiving (the very meaning of “Eucharist”) in
praise and gratitude for all God’s gifts, especially the gift of His Son.
We unite our sacrifices with Christ’s perfect offering, participating in
both dimensions of His redemptive work.

We receive the sacrificed Lord in Holy Communion, taking into
ourselves the Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Christ who is the

                                   120
                                                       Chapter 6 Sacrifice


perfect sacrificial Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world
and perfect love.

We are sent forth to live sacrificially in the world and for the
salvation of souls, making our entire lives a participation in Christ’s
sacrifice.

The Eucharist teaches us that sacrifice is not about destruction but
transformation, not about loss but about love, not about death but
about life. In the Mass, we re-live Christ’s sacrifice and through
this, learn to offer ourselves as Christ offered Himself—completely,
willingly, and lovingly.




6.15 Sacrifice in Different States of Life
Married Life: Spouses sacrifice for each other and their children—
time, energy, resources, personal preferences, career ambitions, leisure
activities. Parents sacrifice sleep for sick children, money for educa-
tion, personal dreams for family stability. This sacrifice creates the
secure environment children need to flourish.

Single Life: Single persons sacrifice for their families of origin, their
communities, their future spouses (through chastity and preparation),
and their spiritual families. They have unique opportunities for sac-
rifice in service, evangelization, and building up the Church.

Religious Life: Religious sacrifice through their vows—poverty (ma-
terial goods), chastity (exclusive human love), and obedience (per-
sonal will). These sacrifices free them for total dedication to God and
service to His people.

Priestly Life: Priests sacrifice through celibacy, availability to their
people, and the demands of pastoral care. They offer the ultimate
sacrifice—the Mass—and unite their lives with Christ’s sacrifice for
the salvation of souls.

Chapter 6 Sacrifice


6.16       How Sacrifice Serves Perfect Love
Sacrifice is not opposed to love—it is love’s most authentic expression.
Our comprehensive definition reveals this clearly: “Perfect love is the
sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant, binding truth, justice, and mercy,
gathering us into life-giving communion.”

Sacrificial Gift: The very essence of love is gift—freely given, not
earned or demanded. Sacrifice transforms love from feeling into action,
from intention into reality.

Covenant: Sacred covenants require sacrificial commitment. Sa-
cred covenants invite us to freely embrace love’s duties and respon-
sibilities. Marriage vows, religious vows, and baptismal promises
are not imposed demands but voluntary commitments we choose—
understanding that authentic love willingly accepts the sacrifice re-
quired to maintain fidelity to the covenant bond.

Binds: Sacrifice binds love to reality by proving its authenticity
through action. Words of love without sacrificial deeds are empty
promises rather than authentic commitment.

True Justice/Mercy: Both justice and mercy require sacrifice. Jus-
tice demands we sacrifice our selfish desires to give others what they
deserve. Mercy demands we sacrifice our desire for revenge to offer
forgiveness instead.

Life-Giving Communion: Authentic communion requires mutual
sacrifice—the willingness to die to self for the good of the other. We
cannot achieve true unity while clinging to selfish desires that divide
us from God and neighbor.


6.17       What Evil Sacrifice Overcomes
Sacrifice conquers the root evil of selfishness that places the self
above God and neighbor. This selfishness manifests in the seven
deadly sins, each representing a different form of disordered self-love:

Pride makes us our own god, rejecting divine truth in favor of our
own opinions. Greed creates disordered attachment to material

                                 122
                                                       Chapter 6 Sacrifice


goods, making us unwilling to share with those in need. Lust reduces
others to objects for our pleasure, corrupting the gift of sexuality into
selfish exploitation.

Envy breeds resentment of others’ good fortune and unwillingness
to rejoice in their happiness. Gluttony demands immediate satisfac-
tion without moderation or gratitude. Wrath seeks revenge rather
than justice and refuses the hard work of forgiveness. Sloth avoids
spiritual and moral responsibility, choosing comfort over service and
growth.

Sacrifice transforms the heart from self-seeking to self-giving, break-
ing the fundamental pattern of evil and opening us to authentic love.
These disordered loves cannot provide meaning, purpose, or fulfill-
ment because they are not the source of all truth, justice, and mercy.
Only God, who created us for love, has the power to save us from
the self-destruction that comes from worshipping anything less than
Himself.


6.18 The Call to Heroic Sacrifice
The Church calls all Christians to heroic virtue, which means heroic
sacrifice. This doesn’t necessarily mean martyrdom (though it might),
but it does mean a life of consistent self-giving that goes beyond what
the world considers normal or reasonable.

For families: Heroic sacrifice might mean praying for your children
daily, staying up all night with a sick child, or giving up a favorite
vacation to support a missionary organization. It might mean order-
ing your entire calendar around the liturgical year, serving the poor
with your time and resources, or putting your life on hold to care for
sick or elderly family members.

For individuals: Heroic sacrifice might mean choosing celibacy for
the Kingdom, dedicating one’s career to serving the poor, or accepting
suffering with joy for the salvation of others. It might mean using your
vacation time to serve at a homeless shelter instead of traveling for
pleasure, tithing generously even when money is tight, or spending
your evenings mentoring troubled youth rather than pursuing hobbies.

                                  123
Chapter 6 Sacrifice


It could mean visiting the sick in hospitals weekly, choosing a lower-
paying job that allows more time for family prayer, or fasting from
social media to deepen your prayer life.

For communities: Heroic sacrifice might mean building schools and
hospitals in dangerous places, defending the truth despite persecution,
or welcoming refugees despite the cost. It might mean a parish tak-
ing on significant debt to build a new church that serves the growing
community, or Catholic schools offering scholarships to low-income
families even when budgets are strained. It could mean organizing
meal trains for new mothers and grieving families, creating mentor-
ship programs for at-risk teens, or pooling resources to support a
family facing medical crisis. It might mean standing publicly for life
despite social pressure, or opening parish halls to shelter the homeless
during winter months.

The measure of our love is the measure of our sacrifice. Those who
love little sacrifice little; those who love much sacrifice much. The
saints loved heroically because they sacrificed heroically.

      Heroic love requires heroic sacrifice.


6.19       Living the Response
Daily Sacrifices: - Daily Mass, Liturgy of the Hours, Rosary, and
other prayer - Daily sacrifice of time to family, friends, and neighbors
- Choosing prayer time over entertainment - Giving alms to the poor
rather than buying luxuries - Serving family members instead of pur-
suing personal comfort - Fasting from food, media, or other pleasures

single freedom - Choosing religious vocation over worldly success -
Choosing moral integrity over financial gain - Choosing truth over
popularity - Choosing forgiveness over revenge

Daily Examination: Each evening, ask yourself: “What did I sacri-
fice today for love? What opportunities for sacrifice did I miss? How
can I grow in generosity tomorrow?”

Lord Jesus Christ, You are perfect sacrifice and perfect love. You
showed us that the greatest love is to lay down one’s life for one’s
friends. Grant us the grace to follow Your example, to find joy in self-
giving, and to discover our true selves through service to others. Help
us to unite our small sacrifices with Your perfect sacrifice, that our
lives might become a living offering acceptable to the Father. Through
the same Christ our Lord. Amen.




6.20 Daily Examen: Sacrifice
Evening Reflection: 1. Gratitude: What opportunities for sacri-
fice did God give me today? 2. Examination: Where did I choose
comfort over service, selfishness over love? 3. Sorrow: How did my
failures to sacrifice harm my relationships or spiritual life? 4. Reso-
lution: What specific sacrifice will I offer tomorrow as an act of love?
5. Prayer: Ask for the grace to find joy in self-giving and strength
for greater sacrifice.

Daily Practice: Before making decisions, ask: “How can this choice
become an act of love? What sacrifice does love require here?” Let
love guide your choices rather than comfort, convenience, or self-
interest.

Act of Contrition: “O my God, I am heartily sorry for having of-
fended You, and I detest all my sins because of Your just punishments,
but most of all because they offend You, my God, who are all-good
and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of Your
grace, to sin no more and to avoid the near occasions of sin. Amen.”

Covenant

      “I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and
      the house of Judah… I will put my law within them, and I
      will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and
      they shall be my people.”

      — Jeremiah 31:31-34

      “What therefore God has joined together, let not man

     richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death
     do us part.”

     — Traditional Wedding Vows

These words, spoken at countless wedding altars, represent one of the
most profound acts of human love possible—the making of a covenant.
But in our culture of disposable relationships and conditional commit-
ments, we have largely forgotten what covenant love actually means.
We treat marriage like a contract that can be broken when incon-
venient, rather than a sacred bond that creates permanent family
relationships.

Why do so many relationships fail today? What’s missing when cou-
ples who once promised “till death do us part” find themselves in
divorce court just a few years later? Could it be that we’ve lost sight
of what covenant love really means?

While the world around us often speaks of marriage failure and broken
relationships, we witness something different in couples who truly un-
derstand and live covenant love. Across the world, we see marriages
that have weathered decades of storms—not because they never faced
tragedy, diﬀiculties, or even betrayal of the wedding vows, but be-
cause they understood their bond as sacred and permanent. They
understood that love is not just a feeling, but rooted in a deep com-
mitment that enables them to transcend the complexities of human
relationship. They were willing to sacrifice for the good of their mar-
riage, for the good of their children, for the good of their community.
These couples become living witnesses to the power of covenant love,
showing their children and communities that authentic love is not just
a beautiful ideal, but a lived reality that transforms both spouses and
creates stable homes where children can flourish.

In our journey through the essential facets of authentic love, we have
explored truth, justice, mercy, and sacrifice in the previous chapters.
Now we discover that all of these virtues find their ultimate expres-
sion and fulfillment in covenant love—the sacred, binding commit-
ment that creates permanent relationships ordered toward the good
of others.

      Covenant love is not merely a human commitment—it is
      participation in God’s own eternal fidelity, making every
      faithful marriage a living sacrament of divine love.


7.2     What Children Know About Covenant
        Love
Children demonstrate pure understanding of covenant love before
adults complicate relationships with prenuptials and escape clauses:

“Families are forever.” Children naturally expect their family to
stay together and are deeply wounded by divorce. They understand
instinctively that love creates permanent bonds, not temporary ar-
rangements, reflecting Jesus’ teaching:

      “What God has joined together, let not man separate”

      — Matthew 19:6

“Promises matter.” Children take promises seriously and remem-
ber when adults break their word. They understand that authentic
love keeps its commitments, mirroring God’s covenant faithfulness:

      “God is not man, that he should lie”

      Numbers 23:19

“Both mom and dad are needed.” Children naturally understand
they need both parents and feel the absence of either. They know from
deep in their soul that mother and father should be together:

      “He said in reply, “Have you not read that from the begin-
      ning the Creator ‘made them male and female’ and said,
      ‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother
      and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one
      flesh’? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore,
      what God has joined together, man must not separate.””

      Matthew 19:4-6

“Love means staying.” Children equate love with presence and
commitment, not just feelings. They understand that real love doesn’t

                                  129
Chapter 7 Covenant


leave when things get hard, echoing Christ’s promise:

      “Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things,
      endures all things.”

      1 Corinthians 13:7

Children understand covenant love naturally because they are made
in the image of a God who loves through covenant. As Jesus said:

      “Unless you turn and become like children, you will never
      enter the kingdom of heaven”

      Matthew 18:3


7.3

7.4     The Universal                    Human          Need           for
        Covenant Love
Every human being, regardless of culture, religion, or background,
demonstrates an unmistakable hunger for covenant love. This isn’t
learned behavior—it’s written into our very nature as beings made in
God’s image.

We Are Made for Relationship

No human being can thrive in isolation. Even the most introverted
person needs deep, committed relationships. We see this universal
truth everywhere:

  • In every culture: Marriage ceremonies, friendship rituals,
    family bonds, and community celebrations all point to our deep
    need for covenant relationships. We see “blood brothers” pacts,
    “best friend forever” promises, adoption rituals that create per-
    manent family bonds
  • In our language: Every language has words for commitment,
    faithfulness, loyalty, betrayal, and abandonment—because
    these realities matter to every human heart. We instinctively
    use covenant language: calling close friends “brother” and

                                   130
                                                  Chapter 7 Covenant


    “sister,” speaking of “chosen family,” “ride or die” friends,
    “blood brothers,” “soul mates,” “partners for life,” and “till
    death do us part.” Even secular culture creates terms like
    “BFF” (Best Friends Forever) because we long for permanent
    bonds
  • In our pain: The deepest human suffering comes from broken
    relationships, abandonment, and betrayal—proving how essen-
    tial covenant love is to our well-being. We see this in the pain
    of divorce (especially the children), the betrayal of a trusted
    friend, or the abandonment of a child
  • In our joy: Our greatest happiness comes from deep, commit-
    ted relationships where we know we are loved unconditionally.
    We see this in the joy of a wedding, the warmth of a family
    reunion, or the comfort of a close friend

The Cry for Permanence

Even in our broken world, humans instinctively cry out for relation-
ships that last:

  • Children need to know their parents will never abandon them
  • Spouses long for “till death do us part” commitment, not con-
    ditional love
  • Friends seek loyalty that endures through diﬀiculties
  • Communities thrive when members are committed to the com-
    mon good

The Failure of Contracts

Human experience proves that contractual relationships—based on
mutual benefit and performance—never satisfy the human heart. We
need something deeper:

  • Contracts say: “I’ll love you if you meet my needs”

  • Covenants say: “I’ll love you because I choose to bind myself
    to you permanently”

  • Contracts say: “This relationship lasts as long as it benefits
    both parties”

                                131
Chapter 7 Covenant


  • Covenants say: “This relationship is permanent, regardless of
    circumstances”

  • Contracts say: “You earn my love through performance”

  • Covenants say: “My love is a gift that creates security for
    growth”

The Universal Witness

This universal human need for covenant love points to something
beyond mere biology or social conditioning. It witnesses to our divine
origin—we need covenant love because we are made in the image of
a God who is covenant love.



7.5     The Universal Cry for Covenant: Ev-
        idence of Our Divine Origin
The human capacity for covenant love isn’t accidental—it’s written
into our very nature because we are made in the image of God, who
is perfect covenant love. From the very beginning, God has related
to humanity through covenants, not mere contracts:

The Father establishes eternal covenants with His people, promis-
ing permanent relationship that endures despite human unfaithful-
ness. His covenant love is not based on our performance but on His
unchanging nature. As He declares:

      “For I the Lord do not change; therefore you, O children
      of Jacob, are not consumed”

      — Malachi 3:6

Even when we are faithless:

      “he remains faithful—for he cannot deny himself”

      — 2 Timothy 2:13

The Son fulfills all previous covenants and establishes the New
Covenant through His death and resurrection. His covenant love for

                                 132
                                                    Chapter 7 Covenant


the Church is so complete that He gives His very Body and Blood to
seal the relationship:

     “This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant
     in my blood”

     — Luke 22:20

Paul explains this covenant love:

     “Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
     and gave himself up for her”

     — Ephesians 5:25

The Holy Spirit writes the law of love on our hearts, enabling us
to live covenant relationships that reflect God’s own faithfulness. As
God promised through Jeremiah:

     “I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their
     hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my
     people”

     — Jeremiah 31:33

The Spirit enables us to cry:

     “Abba! Father!”

     — Romans 8:15

entering into the intimate covenant relationship that defines the Trin-
ity itself.

Because we are made in God’s image, we are created for covenant
relationships. We find our deepest fulfillment not in independence
but in permanent bonds of love that mirror the Trinity’s eternal rela-
tionships.

     The human heart’s natural expectation of permanent love
     reveals our divine origin—we are not accidents of evolu-
     tion but image-bearers of the eternal God who keeps His
     promises forever.

                                 133
Chapter 7 Covenant


7.6     The Divine Pattern: God’s Covenant
        History
God’s love has always been covenant love. From the very beginning,
God has chosen to relate to humanity through covenants—sacred
bonds that create family relationships rather than mere legal con-
tracts. Each covenant reveals more of God’s faithful love and estab-
lishes the pattern that all human covenant relationships must follow.

The Covenant with Adam and Eve: God’s Original Family
Bond

From the very beginning, God established a covenant relationship
with humanity. In the Garden of Eden, God created Adam and Eve
not as servants or subjects, but as His children, made in His own
image and likeness. This original covenant included:

  • Intimate relationship: God walked with them in the cool of
    the day (Genesis 3:8)
  • Delegated authority: They were given authority from God,
    the Author of all creation, to tend and keep the garden and
    have dominion over the animals (Genesis 1:28, 2:15)
  • Sacred work: They were called to cultivate and care for the
    garden—work as participation in God’s creative activity, not
    burden or curse
  • Creative partnership: Adam was given the privilege of nam-
    ing the animals, participating in God’s creative work (Genesis
    2:19-20)
  • Loving submission: They lived in perfect harmony under
    God’s loving authority until they chose rebellion
  • Moral responsibility: The covenant included the freedom to
    choose obedience or disobedience (Genesis 2:16-17)
  • Promise of life: Faithful submission to God’s loving authority
    would lead to eternal life in His presence

Even after the Fall, God’s covenant love pursued them with the first
promise of redemption—that the woman’s offspring would crush the
serpent’s head (Genesis 3:15). This protoevangelium (first gospel)
shows that God’s covenant love is stronger than human unfaithful-

                                134
                                                      Chapter 7 Covenant


ness.

The Covenant with Noah: God’s Universal Commitment

After the flood, God renewed His covenant commitment to all human-
ity:

        “I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall
        all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, and never
        again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth”

        — Genesis 9:11

God gave the rainbow as the covenant sign, declaring:

        “This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me
        and you and every living creature that is with you, for all
        future generations”

        — Genesis 9:12

This covenant reveals God’s permanence—His promises endure re-
gardless of human behavior. Notice that God doesn’t say “if you are
good, I won’t flood the earth again.” The covenant is unconditional,
based on God’s nature, not human performance.

The Covenant with Abraham: God’s Personal Call

God called Abraham by name and established an intimate, personal
relationship:

        “I will establish my covenant between me and you and
        your offspring after you throughout their generations for
        an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your
        offspring after you”

        — Genesis 17:7

God changed Abram’s name to Abraham, meaning “father of many
nations,” and gave circumcision as the covenant sign.

This covenant reveals God’s personal nature—He calls individuals by
name and creates intimate relationships. It also shows God’s fruit-
fulness—the covenant is ordered toward blessing and multiplication:

                                   135
Chapter 7 Covenant


     “I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make you
     into nations, and kings shall come from you”

     — Genesis 17:6

The Covenant at Sinai: God’s Holy Law

At Mount Sinai, God established His covenant with Israel through
Moses:

     “Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice and keep
     my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among
     all peoples, for all the earth is mine”

     — Exodus 19:5

The covenant was sealed with blood:

     “And Moses took the blood and threw it on the people
     and said, ‘Behold the blood of the covenant that the Lord
     has made with you in accordance with all these words’ ”

     — Exodus 24:8

This covenant reveals that God’s love is costly—it requires sacrifice.
The blood sacrifice points forward to Christ’s ultimate sacrifice. It
also shows that covenant creates family relationship—Israel be-
comes God’s “treasured possession,” His chosen people.

The Covenant with David: God’s Eternal Kingdom

God promised David an everlasting dynasty:

     “When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your
     fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall
     come forth from your body, and I will establish his king-
     dom. He shall build a house for my name, and I will
     establish the throne of his kingdom forever”

     — 2 Samuel 7:12-13

This covenant points directly to Christ, the eternal King from David’s
line.

                                 136
                                                    Chapter 7 Covenant


This covenant reveals God’s merciful faithfulness—even when
David’s descendants fail, God remains faithful to His promise. As
the Psalmist declares:

      “If his children forsake my law and do not walk according
      to my rules… I will punish their transgression with the rod
      and their iniquity with stripes, but I will not remove from
      him my steadfast love or be false to my covenant”

      — Psalm 89:30-33

The Pattern of Divine Covenant:

These Old Testament covenants establish the pattern that all authen-
tic covenant relationships follow:

  • Permanent: God’s covenants endure forever, not dependent
    on human faithfulness
  • Personal: God calls people by name and establishes intimate
    relationship
  • Fruitful: God’s covenants always aim at blessing and multipli-
    cation
  • Costly: Every covenant requires sacrifice from God, culminat-
    ing in Christ’s death
  • Merciful: God remains faithful even when His people break
    covenant

      Every human covenant—marriage, priesthood, friendship—
      participates in this divine pattern, making our faithful
      commitments sacramental encounters with God’s own
      unchanging love.



7.7     The New Covenant in Christ: The
        Fulfillment
The New Covenant established by Jesus Christ is the fulfillment of
all previous covenants and the foundation of His Kingdom on earth.
At the Last Supper, Jesus declared:

                                 137
Chapter 7 Covenant


     “This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant
     in my blood”

     — Luke 22:20

Through His death and resurrection, Christ established a covenant
of perfect justice and perfect mercy, creating a Kingdom where God
reigns and His people participate actively in divine life.

Perfect Justice: Christ satisfied all the demands of justice for our
sins:

     “He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree”

     — 1 Peter 2:24

The justice we explored in Chapter 3 finds its ultimate expression
here—Christ gives to God what is truly due (perfect obedience) and
gives to humanity what we truly need (redemption from sin).

Perfect Mercy: Christ offers complete forgiveness and healing to all
who enter His covenant. The mercy we explored in Chapter 4 reaches
its fullness here—not just pardoning our sins but transforming our
hearts and making us citizens of His Kingdom.

Perfect Sacrifice: Here we witness the most beautiful act in all
of creation—perfect love made visible in perfect sacrifice. Christ’s
sacrifice achieves what St. Thomas Aquinas taught defines all true
beauty: integrity, proportion, and clarity.

Integrity—Christ’s sacrifice is perfectly complete, lacking nothing. As
both God and man, His voluntary submission to the Father’s will pro-
vides the one, final sacrifice that fulfills every Old Covenant offering.
The Passover lamb finds its perfect fulfillment in the Lamb of God
who takes away the sins of the world. No other sacrifice will ever be
needed because this one is infinite in value, divine in nature, complete
in scope.

Proportion—In Christ’s sacrifice, truth, justice, and mercy achieve
perfect harmony. Truth is satisfied because sin is acknowledged and
addressed. Justice is fulfilled because the debt is paid by One who
owes nothing. Mercy triumphs because forgiveness flows freely to all

                                  138
                                                    Chapter 7 Covenant


who accept it. These three are not in tension but in perfect symphony,
each enhancing the others in divine proportion.

Clarity—The radiant splendor of God’s love blazes forth most bril-
liantly in this moment. Even humanity’s most egregious crime—
the killing of God Himself—becomes the very means by which God
demonstrates that His love is stronger than our sin, His mercy greater
than our malice, His covenant more enduring than our betrayal. The
Cross becomes not a symbol of defeat but the radiant manifestation
of love’s total victory over evil.

This is perfect love: the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant, binding
truth, justice, and mercy, gathering us into life-giving communion.
In Christ’s sacrifice, we see not just what love does, but what love
is—the very nature of the Trinity poured out for our salvation, beau-
tiful beyond all earthly beauty because it possesses perfect integrity,
perfect proportion, and perfect clarity.

Perfect Covenant: This New Covenant, sealed in Christ’s blood,
accomplishes what no human covenant could ever achieve—it trans-
forms our very nature, enabling us to love as God loves. This is not
merely forgiveness but re-creation:

     “Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that
     those who are called may receive the promised eternal
     inheritance, since a death has occurred that redeems
     them from the transgressions committed under the first
     covenant”

     — Hebrews 9:15

Through Baptism, we die to the old covenant of law and are reborn
into the new covenant of grace. We become not merely forgiven sin-
ners but adopted children, not merely servants but friends, not merely
subjects but co-heirs with Christ. The Holy Spirit writes God’s law
of love on our hearts, transforming us from within so that covenant
fidelity becomes not a burden we bear but the natural expression of
our new nature.

This transformation is profound: what the world calls “duty” be-
comes for us covenant fidelity—the joyful response of hearts that

                                 139
Chapter 7 Covenant


know they are cherished unconditionally. This covenant fidelity, ex-
pressed through daily sacrifice, becomes the wellspring of everything
that makes life meaningful:

   • Our source of meaning: We find purpose not in pursuing our
     own desires but in faithful commitment that serves something
     greater than ourselves
   • Our strength in adversity: When trials come, covenant fi-
     delity gives us the power to persevere because we know our
     suffering has meaning within God’s providential plan
   • Our ability to rise to challenges: Covenant commitment
     calls forth our best selves, enabling us to “go the extra mile”
     and exceed what we thought possible
   • Our alignment with God’s will: Through covenant fidelity,
     our will becomes increasingly united with God’s will, bringing
     deep peace and purpose

This is why saints find joy even in suffering, why martyrs sing in
prison, why parents sacrifice everything for their children without re-
sentment. Covenant fidelity transforms duty from external obligation
into internal fire—the burning desire to give of ourselves as we have
been given to.

This covenant is unbreakable from God’s side—even when we fail, He
remains faithful. It is transformative in its power—changing us from
glory to glory. It is eternal in its duration—binding us to God forever.
It is fruitful in its effects—enabling us to love others with the same
covenant love we have received.

When We Fail, Mercy and Justice Restore Us

The New Covenant includes God’s perfect provision for our failures.
His mercy and justice work together to help us when we fall short of
covenant fidelity. Nothing can separate us from God’s commitment
to us—except our own choice to reject His grace. As St. Paul declares,
“neither death nor life… nor anything else in all creation, will be able
to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans
8:38-39).

Yet when we violate truth, justice, mercy, or sacrifice—when we dis-

                                  140
                                                    Chapter 7 Covenant


honor His perfect sacrifice through our infidelity—we wound not only
our relationship with God but also damage the very fabric of His
Kingdom. Our covenant failures ripple outward:

  • Harming our families: Broken covenant fidelity destroys the
    security children need and the unity spouses require
  • Wounding society: When covenant people fail to live
    covenant principles, the world loses its witness to authentic
    relationship
  • Dishonoring the Gospel: Our failures make the “good news”
    of reconciliation seem like empty words rather than transforma-
    tive reality

This is why covenant fidelity matters so deeply—not as mere rule-
following, but as grateful response to the One who gave everything to
reconcile us to Himself and to each other. Our faithfulness becomes
our thanksgiving, our way of saying “yes” to the good news that we
can indeed be reconciled to God and live in harmony with one another
for the flourishing of His Kingdom.

All the previous facets of love—truth, justice, mercy, sacrifice—come
together in this permanent bond that unites us to God forever and
empowers us to live as His covenant people in the world.

When we enter into the New Covenant through Baptism, we become
not just forgiven individuals but citizens of God’s Kingdom, called
to live covenant relationships that reflect and build up His reign on
earth. Every covenant relationship—marriage, religious life, friend-
ship, family bonds—becomes a way of participating in and advancing
God’s Kingdom.

This New Covenant becomes the model for all human covenant re-
lationships, especially marriage and family. Just as Christ’s love for
the Church is permanent, exclusive, fruitful, and sacrificial, so human
covenant love must embody these same characteristics.

     In Christ’s New Covenant, truth, justice, mercy, and sac-
     rifice achieve perfect harmony—revealing that covenant
     love is not one virtue among many, but the very form in
     which all authentic love finds completion.

                                 141
Chapter 7 Covenant


7.8     What Evil This Overcomes
Covenant love directly combats the evil of disposable relationships
that treats people as temporary conveniences rather than permanent
commitments. This evil corrupts every dimension of authentic love:
it denies the truth of our nature as beings made for permanent re-
lationship, violates the justice we owe to those who trust us, refuses
the mercy that requires patient commitment, and avoids the sacrifice
that covenant demands.

The evil of disposable relationships manifests in:

Personal Evil: The selfishness that refuses permanent commitment,
preferring to keep options open rather than giving oneself totally to
another. This creates a life of shallow relationships that never achieve
true intimacy or true communion.

Relational Evil: The breakdown of trust that occurs when people
cannot rely on others to keep their commitments. This creates cy-
cles of abandonment, betrayal, and emotional wounds that pass from
generation to generation.

Social Evil: The collapse of stable institutions (families, communi-
ties, organizations) that occurs when people treat all relationships as
temporary and conditional. This creates societies built on self-interest
rather than mutual commitment.

Spiritual Evil: The inability to trust God’s promises when we have
experienced broken covenant love in our lives. People who have been
through divorce, abandonment, or other failures of covenant love
struggle to believe in God’s covenant faithfulness.

Covenant love overcomes these evils by creating the permanent bonds
that enable authentic communion—with God, with others, and within
ourselves. But most crucially, covenant love provides the only alter-
native to nihilistic despair when confronted with the worst of human
evil.

The Ultimate Test: Mercy for the Unforgivable

Without the possibility of true mercy and restoration even for the

                                 142
                                                   Chapter 7 Covenant


most egregious failures—mass murder, rape, genocide, abortion,
betrayal—society inevitably descends into a nihilistic worldview
where only power and control matter. When there is no path back
from the worst sins, when no redemption is possible, then might
becomes right and evil multiplies exponentially. History proves this:
the Holocaust, Stalin’s purges, Mao’s genocides, the killing fields
of Cambodia—all emerged from worldviews that greatly distorted
justice by denying that all humans are created in the image of God,
and pursued goals that were fundamental offenses to truth, justice,
and mercy, offering no ultimate mercy and no covenant path to
restoration.

But covenant love declares that even the worst sinner can be restored.
Even the murderer can find forgiveness. Even the one who has de-
stroyed innocent life can be reconciled to God and community. This is
not cheap grace that ignores justice, but costly mercy that transforms
hearts and makes genuine repentance possible.

Personal Restoration: The Path Back from Our Worst

This matters not just for society but for each of us personally. When
you or I commit grave sin—when we betray those we love most, when
we destroy what is precious, when we become the very evil we once
condemned—we need a way back. Without covenant mercy, we face
only two choices: denial (pretending our sin wasn’t that bad) or de-
spair (believing we are beyond redemption).

The New Covenant offers a third way: genuine repentance leading
to authentic restoration. Through the Sacrament of Reconciliation,
through the community of faith, through the patient work of rebuild-
ing trust, even the worst failures can become testimonies to the power
of covenant love. The murderer can become a saint. The betrayer can
become a faithful friend. The destroyer can become a healer.

This is why covenant fidelity, rooted in God’s truth about what
authentic relationship truly is, becomes the foundation of human
flourishing—it proves that no one is beyond redemption, that every
relationship can be healed, that even the worst evil cannot have the
final word.

                                 143
Chapter 7 Covenant


      The New Covenant becomes humanity’s only hope against
      nihilistic despair—proving that mercy is stronger than
      the worst evil, that restoration is possible even after the
      gravest sin, and that covenant love can heal what seems
      permanently broken.


7.9     God’s Initiative: The Foundation of
        All Covenant Love
But how do we find the strength to live such demanding love? The
answer lies in understanding the source of all covenant love.

Here we discover the most beautiful truth of all: God loved us first.
Before we ever thought to seek God, He sought us. Before we knew
what love meant, He loved us into existence. Before we could choose
Him, He chose us. As St. John declares:

      “In this is love, not that we loved God but that he loved
      us and sent his Son to be the propitiation (a sacrificial
      offering to repair injustice) for our sins”

      — 1 John 4:10

Every human covenant relationship—marriage, priesthood, religious
life, friendship—is our response to God’s prior love, our participation
in the covenant He first established with us.

God has revealed His immense love for us through three magnificent
gifts: His creation (which declares His glory), our hearts (where He
writes His law of both justice and mercy), and Sacred Scripture (His
living Word). In creation, we see His truth—the ordered beauty that
reflects His nature. In our hearts, we feel His justice and mercy—
the moral law that calls us to righteousness (to do what is true, just
and merciful) and the compassion that moves us to forgiveness. In
Scripture, we encounter His promises—the covenant faithfulness that
assures us of redemption.

When these three revelations are integrated through covenant love,
we experience what our hearts have always longed for: life-giving

                                 144
                                                      Chapter 7 Covenant


communion with God and with one another.


7.10 The Call to Covenant Living
This is why covenant love is the foundation of authentic
relationships—it creates the secure framework within which truth,
justice, mercy, and sacrifice can flourish together. In a world dying
from disposable relationships, broken promises, and conditional
commitments, God calls us to be living witnesses to His covenant
love.

Every baptized Christian is called to this mission: to live covenant
love so authentically that others see the possibility of permanent,
faithful relationships. Whether in marriage, priesthood, religious life,
or faithful friendship, we are called to prove that love is stronger than
selfishness, that commitment is more powerful than convenience, and
that permanent relationships are the foundation of human flourishing.

The world desperately needs this witness. Children need to see mar-
riages that endure. Communities need to see friendships that last.
The Church needs to see priests who remain faithful. Society needs
to see people who keep their word. In every covenant relationship we
live faithfully, we participate in God’s own covenant love and become
instruments of His grace for the salvation of the world.

The Promise and the Call

God’s covenant love never fails. Even when we fail, His love endures.
Even when we break our promises, His promises remain. Even when
we abandon Him, He never abandons us. This is the hope that sus-
tains His covenant: we are held together by a love that is stronger
than our weakness, more faithful than our fickleness, more permanent
than our failures.

But this hope comes with a call: to let God’s covenant love transform
us from people who take to people who give, from people who leave
to people who stay, from people who make excuses to people who
keep promises. Through Baptism, we enter His covenant. Through
the Eucharist, we renew it. Through our daily choices, we live it.

                                  145
Chapter 7 Covenant


The question that remains is simple but profound: Will you live
covenant love? Will you be a person others can count on? Will
you create relationships that reflect God’s own faithfulness? Will you
help heal a world broken by disposable relationships?

      Covenant love is not merely a human ideal to strive for—it
      is God’s own life being lived through us, transforming ev-
      ery faithful commitment into a participation in the eternal
      communion of the Trinity.

The choice is yours. But remember: you do not choose alone. The
God who first loved you, who called you by name, who wrote His law
on your heart—He stands ready to give you every grace you need to
live covenant love authentically. In Him, permanent love is not just
possible—it is the very purpose for which you were created.


7.11      Living the Response
Covenant love calls us to radical commitment in a culture that
worships human desires and fears permanent bonds. Whether we are
married, single, or religious, we are all called to live covenant love in
our relationships:

Daily Covenant Fidelity: - Attend Mass daily or at minimum read
the daily readings through the Liturgy of the Hours, the Magnificat
and many other sources - Begin each day by renewing your baptismal
promises - Choose commitment over convenience in small decisions
- Support others in their covenant relationships through prayer and
practical help - When you fail, remember that God’s covenant endures
despite our unfaithfulness—and that we are finite beings called to
faithfulness, not to be saviors of the world on our own - Remember
that proper justice and mercy applies to you also, patiently let God
teach you to grow into the image of Christ - Witness to God’s covenant
love through faithfulness in all relationships

Covenant Witness in the World: - Defend the truth about perma-
nent commitment in a culture that attacks it - Pray for good strong
marriages - Pray for the children who traumatized by broken mar-
riages - Pray for those in covenant relationships, especially those fac-

                                  146

ing diﬀiculties in marriage and religious life - Welcome those seeking
to understand or restore covenant relationships - Make every rela-
tionship an opportunity to practice covenant fidelity - Break cycles
of broken love in your family and community

Daily Examination: Each evening, ask yourself: “How did I live
covenant love today? Where did I choose commitment over conve-
nience? How can I grow in faithfulness tomorrow?”

Lord Jesus Christ, You are the perfect covenant keeper, establishing
the New Covenant through Your death and resurrection. Thank You
for calling us into covenant relationship with You and showing us the
pattern of permanent, faithful love. Grant us the grace to live covenant
love in all our relationships—permanent, faithful, and ordered toward
life-giving communion. When we fail in our covenant commitments,
remind us that Your love endures forever. Help us to break cycles
of broken love and create legacies of authentic covenant love for the
salvation of the world and the building up of Your Kingdom. Through
the same Christ our Lord. Amen.



7.12 Examen: Covenant Love
Evening Reflection: 1. Gratitude: What opportunities for
covenant fidelity did God give me today? 2. Examination: Where
did I choose convenience over commitment, self-interest over covenant
love? 3. Sorrow: How did my failures in covenant love harm my
relationships or spiritual life? 4. Resolution: What specific act
of covenant fidelity will I offer tomorrow? 5. Prayer: Ask for the
grace to live permanent, faithful love in all relationships.

Daily Practice: Before making decisions, ask: “How does this choice
serve my covenant commitments? What does covenant love require
here?” Let covenant fidelity guide your choices rather than conve-
nience, options, or self-interest.

Act of Contrition: “O my God, I am heartily sorry for having of-
fended You, and I detest all my sins because of Your just punishments,
but most of all because they offend You, my God, who are all-good

                                  147
Chapter 7 Covenant


and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of Your
grace, to sin no more and to avoid the near occasions of sin. Amen.”

      “Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ loved the
      church and handed himself over for her.”

      — Ephesians 5:25

      “I will put my laws on their hearts, and write them on
      their minds.”

8.1     The Integration of All Love’s Facets
In our journey through the essential facets of authentic love, we have
discovered a breathtaking truth at the heart of God’s love as He has
revealed it: Love is not a single virtue but the perfect integra-
tion of all virtues, each absolutely necessary and completely
dependent on the others.

                                 150
                                                Chapter 8 The Sacraments


This is the revolution of the Gospel—that love requires truth because
we cannot love what we do not truly know. We must see the Holy
Trinity as He is (Creator, Redeemer, Sustainer), ourselves as we are,
and our neighbors as they truly are: beloved children made in God’s
image. Without truth, our “love” becomes delusion, sentiment, or
manipulation.

But truth alone is not enough. Love demands true justice—not
the world’s justice that seeks revenge or maintains power, but God’s
justice that gives to each what they are truly due. And what has
God revealed to us? That He loves us immensely—creating us in
His image, pouring out His grace through creation, and promising
us eternal communion with Him. True justice recognizes both our
complete dependence on God and His freely given love, inviting us
into true relationships. Without justice, love becomes permissiveness
that enables evil.

Yet justice without true mercy becomes cruelty. True mercy is not
weakness or compromise with evil—it is strength that chooses rec-
onciliation over revenge, healing over punishment, restoration over
destruction. Mercy sees the truth of human brokenness and responds
with justice tempered by compassion. You cannot have true justice
without mercy, for unmerciful justice denies the truth of human weak-
ness. You cannot have true mercy without justice, for unjust mercy
denies the truth of human dignity and responsibility. They are insep-
arable facets of the same precious gem of love—each reflecting and
requiring the other.

All of this requires sacrifice—the costly self-gift that makes love real.
Love is not merely feeling or intention; it is action that costs us some-
thing. Without sacrifice, our “love” remains in the realm of wishes
and dreams, never becoming incarnate in the world.

And all must be bound together by covenant—the permanent com-
mitment that creates the secure space for truth, justice, mercy, and
sacrifice to flourish. Without covenant, our love remains conditional,
ready to flee when the cost becomes clear.

      Perfect love is the integration of truth, justice, and

                                  151
Chapter 8 The Sacraments


      mercy—made real by sacrifice and secured by covenant.

This is how we overcome the moral evil in our hearts. The evil
that whispers we can love without truth (living in delusion), or have
justice without mercy (becoming tyrants), or show mercy without
justice (enabling destruction), or love without sacrifice (remaining
in selfishness), or commit without permanence (keeping our escape
routes open).

Do you see it? This integrated love—this perfect harmony of truth,
justice, mercy, sacrifice, and covenant—this is the entire Bible.
This is the whole history of salvation. This is what God has been
teaching humanity from the Garden to Golgotha. This is the Good
News of Jesus Christ in its fullness.

And where do we see this perfect integration most clearly? On the
Cross. There, Jesus revealed the ultimate truth about God and
humanity—that God is love and we are worth dying for. There, He
satisfied perfect justice by taking upon Himself the debt we owed for
sin. There, He poured out infinite mercy, forgiving even those who
crucified Him. There, He made the ultimate sacrifice, laying down
His life for His friends. And there, He established the New Covenant
in His Body and Blood, the unbreakable bond that unites us to God
forever. On the Cross, Jesus fulfilled all the law and the prophets,
showing us that authentic love is not abstract theology but flesh and
blood poured out. The Cross is love incarnate—every facet blazing
forth in perfect unity.



8.2     The Role of the Church
But how do we learn to live this integrated love? How do we grow in
the perfect harmony of truth, justice, mercy, sacrifice, and covenant
that we see on the Cross? This is where Christ’s Church becomes
essential to our journey.

When Paul speaks of “the law of Christ” (Galatians 6:2), he is not
referring to a new set of external rules, but to the internal transfor-
mation that comes from living in covenant relationship with Jesus.

                                 152
                                               Chapter 8 The Sacraments


This law of Christ is written on our hearts through the Holy Spirit,
enabling us to love as Christ loves.

Jesus established His Church with the mission to baptize and teach
all nations (Matthew 28:19-20), giving her the authority to guide us
into this same law of Christ. The Church fulfills this mission not
through arbitrary rules, but by providing the means through which
we encounter God’s transforming love: the Sacred Scriptures that
reveal truth, the Mass that makes present Christ’s sacrifice, and the
Sacraments that channel His grace into our lives.

Many criticize the Catholic Church as being like the Pharisees with
all their rules and regulations. But there is a crucial difference: the
Pharisees sought to make themselves appear holy through external
observance, while the Church draws us into humble, obedient com-
munion with God so that we can actually become holy—sanctified
from within by grace, transformed into true witnesses of God’s love.

The Mass, Sacraments, and the Church’s guidance are not burdens
but invitations—pathways that lead us deeper into covenant love with
God. They are the wisdom of two thousand years of saints who
discovered how to live the integrated love we see on the Cross. When
we participate in the sacramental life of the Church, we are not trying
to earn God’s love; we are learning to receive it more fully and share
it more authentically.

      The Church exists to form saints—not through external
      rules, but through sacramental encounter with Christ’s
      transforming perfect love.


8.3     What Is a Sacrament?
Before we explore how the sacraments structure our covenant rela-
tionship with God, we need to understand what a sacrament actually
is. A sacrament is God’s chosen way of pouring out His perfect love—
that sacred gift we’ve been exploring throughout this book—directly
into our lives through visible signs and actions.

Remember our definition of God’s perfect love: the integration of

                                 153
Chapter 8 The Sacraments


truth, justice, mercy, sacrifice, and covenant. In every sacrament, we
experience this same perfect love pouring out on us as pure gift. We
don’t earn it, we don’t deserve it, we simply receive it because God is
the initiator—He is the one who established these sacred encounters
and continues to give Himself through them.

When Jesus instituted the sacraments during His earthly ministry,
He was creating permanent channels through which His perfect love
could flow to us across all time and space. Whether it’s the cleansing
waters of Baptism, the nourishing bread and wine of the Eucharist, or
the healing touch of the priest in Confession, each sacrament is God
actively pouring out that sacred gift of His perfect love upon us.

      “The sacraments are eﬀicacious signs of grace, instituted
      by Christ and entrusted to the Church, by which divine
      life is dispensed to us.”

      — Catechism of the Catholic Church 1131

This is why the sacraments are so powerful—they are not mere sym-
bols or human ceremonies, but God Himself giving us His perfect love
in ways we can see, touch, taste, and experience. In every sacrament,
that sacred gift pours out on us, transforming us from within and
drawing us deeper into covenant relationship with Him.


8.4     Growing Toward Perfect Love
But we aren’t perfect. How can we love like Jesus? The beautiful
truth is that we have real choices, and with God’s grace, we can
make progress toward the perfect love He desires for us.

Can you avoid murder, rape, genocide—can you avoid mortal sin?
Yes! Can you avoid adultery, theft, blasphemy, apostasy, despair,
presumption—other mortal sins that destroy our relationship with
God? Yes! We absolutely have this choice. We can ask Jesus to help
shape our intellect and direct our will toward choosing what is true
and just and merciful.

This is the wonderful gift Paul gives us in warning us about sins that
are deadly to the soul:

                                 154
                                                 Chapter 8 The Sacraments


     “If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to
     death, he shall ask, and God will give him life—to those
     who commit sins that do not lead to death. There is sin
     that leads to death; I do not say that one should pray for
     that. All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not
     lead to death.”

     — Galatians 6:7-8

Paul warns us so that we can fulfill the perfect love God desires for
us—avoiding mortal sin (sin that destroys our relationship with God)
and hopefully maturing in faith so that the only sins we commit are
venial sins.

Venial sin is sin that wounds but does not destroy our relationship
with God—like small arguments in a marriage that create tension but
don’t threaten the fundamental bond. Venial sins include things like
minor dishonesty, small acts of selfishness, losing our temper briefly, or
failing to pray when we intended to. These sins weaken our spiritual
life and make us more susceptible to serious sin, but they don’t cut
us off from God’s grace entirely.

This is God’s plan for our spiritual growth: that we would mature
from committing mortal sins (relationship-destroying) to committing
only venial sins (relationship-wounding), and eventually, through the
sacraments and daily grace, grow in such union with Christ that we
sin less and less. This is how we can be perfect as Jesus and the
Father are perfect:

     “You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father
     is perfect.”

     — Matthew 5:48

This perfection isn’t achieved through our own willpower alone, but
through the sacramental life that channels God’s grace into our souls,
gradually transforming us from within until we truly love as Christ
loves. Jesus calls us into His idea of a perfect, integrated love rather
than our human idea that we must be without any sin whatsoever in
order to be perfect.

                                   155
Chapter 8 The Sacraments


8.5     The Sacramental Structure of Covenant
        Love
The seven sacraments exist, well first because Jesus established them,
but also because authentic covenant relationships need a complete
structure—not just a single moment of encounter, but a full frame-
work for living in relationship with God. Just as human relation-
ships have different stages and needs (meeting, commitment, ongoing
communication, reconciliation when needed), our covenant with God
unfolds through different sacramental encounters. Each sacrament
reveals a different aspect of how God creates and strengthens our
covenant bonds with Him and each other through these encounters
where His perfect love pours out on us.

Baptism: God Makes Us His Children

What does it mean to become God’s child? Baptism initiates us
into the fundamental covenant relationship with God, creating a per-
manent bond that can never be broken. Through baptism, all the
dimensions of perfect love come together: the truth of our identity as
God’s children, the justice of right relationship with our Creator, the
mercy that washes away original sin, and the sacrifice of Christ that
makes it all possible.

Entering the Kingdom as Children of the Father

When we enter the Church through Baptism, we are not merely join-
ing a human organization—we are entering as children of our Father
into the Kingdom of God itself. Baptism leaves an indelible mark on
our soul, a spiritual seal that can never be removed or destroyed. We
become permanent members of God’s Kingdom, citizens of heaven
even while we journey on earth.

      “Baptism seals the Christian with the indelible spiritual
      mark of his belonging to Christ. No sin can erase this
      mark, even if sin prevents Baptism from bearing the fruits
      of salvation.”

      — Catechism of the Catholic Church 1272

                                 156
                                               Chapter 8 The Sacraments


This is why you are “registered” in a parish, but your membership
is truly in the Kingdom of God. Parish registration is merely
administrative—a practical way to organize pastoral care and
community life. But your real membership, your true citizenship,
is in the Kingdom of Heaven itself. The parish serves you as a
member of God’s universal family, but it does not define or limit
your membership.

Universal Access Through Baptismal Citizenship

This Kingdom membership explains why you can go to any Catholic
Church in the entire world and participate in the Sacraments.
Whether you’re in Rome or rural Africa, New York or a tiny village
in the Philippines, your baptismal citizenship in God’s Kingdom
grants you access to the same Eucharist, the same sacraments, the
same spiritual home. The priest may speak a different language, the
customs may vary, but you are family—a child of the same Father, a
citizen of the same Kingdom.

Catholic baptism creates something profound—permanent incorpo-
ration into Christ’s Mystical Body, the universal Church that tran-
scends all earthly boundaries.

Confirmation: God Strengthens Us for Mission

Why do we need Confirmation if we’re already baptized? Confirma-
tion completes baptismal initiation by providing the opportunity for
personal ratification of the covenant our parents chose for us. At
Confirmation, we personally answer the same questions asked at Bap-
tism, but now with mature understanding and free choice. It’s like
a teenager saying “Yes, I want to be part of this family” rather than
simply being born into it.

The Holy Spirit, who first came upon us at Baptism, now strengthens
us with His gifts for the mission of living covenant love in the world.
Through Confirmation, we receive the spiritual strength needed to wit-
ness to Christ’s covenant love, especially when it’s diﬀicult or costly.

The Eucharist: God Feeds Us with His Own Life

Why does the Church require weekly Mass attendance? The Eucharist

                                 157
Chapter 8 The Sacraments


stands at the center of all covenant relationships as the source and
summit of covenant love. In Jesus’ own words, “This is my blood of
the new covenant” (Matthew 26:28), the Mass is the ultimate new
covenant renewal ceremony.

     “The Eucharist is the source and summit of the Christian
     life.”

     — Catechism of the Catholic Church 1324

But the Eucharist is far more than just a weekly obligation—it is
our regular participation in the New Covenant itself. Every time
we receive Holy Communion, we are literally receiving the Body and
Blood of Christ that sealed the New Covenant on Calvary. We are not
just remembering what Jesus did; we are participating in the eternal
reality of His sacrifice.

The Mass as Covenant Renewal:

     The Mass is covenant renewal: God speaks, we offer,
     Christ gives Himself, and we are sent for mission.

Just as married couples benefit from regularly renewing their vows,
the Eucharist provides regular opportunity to renew our covenant
with God. But unlike human covenant renewals, the Mass makes
present the very sacrifice that established the covenant. At every
Mass:

  • We gather as God’s covenant family, called together by
    His Word
  • We hear the covenant promises proclaimed in Scripture
  • We offer ourselves along with Christ’s perfect sacrifice
  • We receive Christ Himself as the seal and guarantee of the
    covenant
  • We are sent forth to live covenant love in the world
  • We participate in the Kingdom of God - joining our efforts
    with our brothers and sisters in Christ to make the Kingdom of
    God a reality on earth.

Daily Mass and Frequent Communion:

While the Church requires weekly Mass attendance, she encourages

                                158
                                              Chapter 8 The Sacraments


daily participation when possible. Why? Because covenant love needs
constant renewal. Just as married couples need daily expressions of
love to keep their relationship strong, our covenant with God flour-
ishes through frequent Eucharistic communion.

The saints understood this.

     “It is not to remain in a golden ciborium that He comes
     down each day from heaven, but to find another heaven,
     the heaven of our soul in which He takes delight.”

     — St. Thérèse of Lisieux

Daily Mass becomes daily covenant renewal, daily reception of the
grace we need to live authentic love.

As a member of the Kingdom, how will you receive the marching
orders of the Church and join the parish in prayer, witness, fasting,
and works of mercy?

The Eucharist and All Other Relationships:

The Eucharist doesn’t just renew our covenant with God—it strength-
ens every other covenant relationship in our lives. Spouses who attend
Mass together regularly report stronger marriages. Families who pray
together and receive Communion together experience deeper unity.
Priests who celebrate Mass faithfully find their pastoral love renewed
and strengthened.

This is because the Eucharist is the source of all covenant love.
Christ’s perfect love, received in Holy Communion, becomes the
power by which we love others with His own love. We cannot give
what we do not have, but in the Eucharist, we receive the very love
of God Himself.

Reconciliation: God Welcomes Us Home

But what happens when we damage our relationship with God
through sin? When we fail in our covenant commitments—whether
to God, spouse, or community by offending God’s truth, justice,
mercy, and covenant—God provides the Sacrament of Reconciliation
to restore communion within the existing covenant bond.

                                 159
Chapter 8 The Sacraments


Think of it like this: when a married couple has a terrible fight or one
spouse commits adultery, they’re still married. The wedding ring is
still on their finger, the marriage certificate is still valid, but they’re
no longer living in harmony. They’ve lost the closeness, trust, and
intimacy that marriage is meant to provide.

The same thing happens with God when we commit serious sin. Our
“spiritual birth certificate” (baptism) is still valid—God is still our Fa-
ther and we’re still His children. But we’ve lost the close relationship.
We’re no longer living in harmony with Him. The love and grace that
should flow freely between us gets blocked by our sin.

This is why we need the Sacrament of Reconciliation. We don’t need
to get “re-baptized” any more than an estranged married couple needs
to get “re-married.” We need to restore the relationship within the
permanent bond that already exists.

      “Those who approach the sacrament of Penance obtain
      pardon from God’s mercy for the offense committed
      against him, and are, at the same time, reconciled with
      the Church.”

     — Catechism of the Catholic Church 1422

Frequent Confession and Covenant Fidelity:

The Church recommends frequent confession, even for venial sins, be-
cause covenant relationships require constant attention and care. Just
as married couples need regular communication to maintain intimacy,
our covenant with God benefits from regular confession to maintain
the free flow of grace and love.

The Root Solution to Human Pain:

Even the modern world recognizes the need for private counseling,
accountability, getting things off our chest, psychologists, and ther-
apeutic intervention. But what if we were dealing with the actual
root of our pain—the sin that wounds us and others, both our own
failures and the sins committed against us? What if we were doing
a better job of living in true communion through the Sacraments, es-
pecially regular Reconciliation that addresses sin at its source rather

                                   160
                                              Chapter 8 The Sacraments


than merely its symptoms?


Perhaps then we would not need so many of these secular substi-
tutes, and the spiritual health of our society would dramatically im-
prove! The Sacrament of Reconciliation doesn’t just provide emo-
tional relief—it provides actual healing of the soul, restoration of
grace, and genuine reconciliation with God and neighbor. It addresses
not just how we feel about our problems, but the spiritual reality that
underlies them.


      Pastoral practice: aim for monthly confession and add
      one weekday Mass when possible—let covenant love be
      renewed often.




8.6     What Children Learn Through the
        Sacraments

  • Baptism: Identity and Permanence — “I belong to God
    forever.” Children see that love creates a permanent family
    bond.
  • Confirmation: Mission and Strength — “God equips me
    to do good.” They learn love sends us on mission with grace.
  • Eucharist: Communion and Presence — “Jesus really
    unites Himself to me.” They experience covenant communion.
  • Reconciliation: Mercy and Healing — “When I am sorry,
    love restores.” They learn mercy heals relationships.
  • Matrimony: Fidelity and Fruitfulness — “Love stays and
    gives life.” They witness permanent, life‑giving commitment.
  • Holy Orders: Service and Fatherhood — “Love serves
    everyone.” Priests model sacrificial pastoral love.
  • Anointing of the Sick: Hope and Care — “God is with us
    when we suffer.” Love remains to the end.

Chapter 8 The Sacraments


8.7     Marriage: God Creates the Funda-
        mental Human Covenant
Marriage is the fundamental human “communion”, imaging God’s
covenant with His people. This is why Scripture consistently uses
marriage as the metaphor for God’s relationship with His people—
because marriage, when lived authentically, reveals the very nature
of divine love.

The Archetype of Covenant Love:

Marriage is the archetype of all covenant relationships, reflecting
God’s own faithful love. Christ’s New Covenant provides the ultimate
model for all loving commitments. We see its principles powerfully
embodied in the Church’s understanding of sacramental marriage,
which is built on four marks reflecting God’s own faithful love:

The Four Marks of Covenant Marriage:

1. Permanent: “What God has joined together, let no man sep-
arate” (Matthew 19:6). Marriage creates a bond that endures until
death, not a contract that can be dissolved when inconvenient. This
permanence provides the security necessary for authentic intimacy
and the stable foundation children need to thrive.

2. Exclusive: Marriage requires the total gift of self to one person.
This exclusivity protects the covenant from the division that comes
from competing loyalties and creates the deep intimacy that comes
from complete self-donation.

3. Fruitful: Marriage is ordered toward the generation and educa-
tion of children. This fruitfulness ensures that covenant love extends
beyond the couple to create new life and build up the human family.

4. Sacred: Marriage is a “sacred act” or “sacrament” that makes
God’s love visible in the world. Through their covenant love, spouses
become living icons of Christ’s love for the Church, witnessing to the
possibility of permanent, faithful love.

The Sacramental Reality:

In the Sacrament of Matrimony, God Himself joins the couple who

                                 162
                                               Chapter 8 The Sacraments


freely choose to enter into this covenant together, making their love a
participation in His own divine love. This is why the Church teaches
that a valid marriage cannot be dissolved—because God Himself has
created the bond. The couple doesn’t just promise to love each other;
they become one flesh through God’s action, creating a new reality
that transcends their individual wills.

      The intimate partnership of married life and love has been
      established by the Creator and qualified by His laws, and
      is rooted in the conjugal covenant of irrevocable personal
      consent.

      — Second Vatican Council

Through their marriage covenant, spouses create what St. John Paul
II called “a communion of persons”—a living image of the Trinity’s
own life of love.


8.8     Holy Orders: God Calls Men to Pas-
        toral Love for His People
While marriage images Christ’s love for the Church through spousal
love, Holy Orders images that same love through pastoral love.
Through ordination, priests become alter Christus (another Christ),
while deacons are configured to Christ the Servant. Both enter into
covenant relationships to serve and strengthen all other covenant
relationships.

The Nature of Priestly Covenant:

Just as marriage follows the biblical covenant pattern, so does priestly
ordination. The priest’s calling mirrors the essential characteristics
of all covenant love, though expressed through pastoral rather than
spousal love:

Permanent Bond: “You are a priest forever according to the or-
der of Melchizedek” (Psalm 110:4). Ordination creates an indelible
spiritual mark that can never be removed, just as marriage creates a
permanent bond.

                                  163
Chapter 8 The Sacraments


Exclusive Commitment: The priest gives his entire life to Christ
and His Church. Celibacy is not merely a discipline but a sign of his
undivided heart—his spousal love for the Church as his bride. This
exclusive commitment mirrors the exclusive love required in marriage,
but directed toward the entire People of God.

Fruitful Mission: Priestly covenant is ordered toward spiritual fa-
therhood. Through the sacraments, priests generate and nurture spir-
itual life, baptizing souls into God’s family, feeding them with the
Eucharist, healing them through Reconciliation, and witnessing their
covenant commitments in marriage.

Sacred Reality: Through ordination, the priest is sacramentally
configured to Christ the High Priest. He doesn’t merely represent
Christ—he acts in persona Christi, making Christ’s covenant love
present and active in the world.

The Priestly Call: Response to the World’s Suffering

Most authentic priestly vocations begin with a profound recognition
of the world’s spiritual poverty and a burning desire to alleviate that
suffering by bringing God’s love to souls. The future priest sees people
dying spiritually without the sacraments, living in darkness without
the Gospel, and trapped in sin without access to mercy. His heart
breaks for their condition, and he feels called to “be Jesus” to them
for their salvation.

This is an expression of covenant love in its purest form—the willing-
ness to lay down one’s life for others. As Christ declared: “The good
shepherd lays down his life for the sheep” (John 10:11). The priest’s
entire life becomes a living sacrifice offered for the salvation of souls.
He offers not just occasional sacrifices but his whole life—his poten-
tial for marriage and family, his personal ambitions, his time and
energy—all for the sake of God’s people. Every Mass he celebrates
is both Christ’s perfect sacrifice and his own personal offering of life
for the Church.

      Don’t forget to thank your priest for his life of service to
      you and the Church!

How Priestly Covenant Serves All Other Covenants:

                                  164
                                                Chapter 8 The Sacraments


The priestly covenant exists to serve and strengthen every other
covenant relationship:

   • Baptism: Priests initiate souls into God’s covenant family
   • Confirmation: They strengthen people’s covenant commit-
     ment
   • Marriage: They witness and bless spousal covenant love
   • Reconciliation: They restore broken covenant communion
   • Eucharist: They provide the covenant renewal that strength-
     ens all relationships
   • Anointing: They prepare souls for the eternal covenant in
     heaven

Without priests living their covenant faithfully, all other covenant re-
lationships suffer. Marriage and family life depend on the sacraments
that only priests can provide. This is why attacks on the priesthood
are ultimately attacks on marriage and family—they seek to deprive
covenant relationships of the grace they need to flourish.

The priest’s celibate love doesn’t compete with married love—it serves
married love by providing the spiritual fatherhood that families need.
Every faithful priest becomes a spiritual father to countless souls, gen-
erating spiritual life through the sacraments and nurturing it through
pastoral care.


8.9     Religious Life and Consecrated Vir-
        ginity: The Covenant of Total Conse-
        cration
Beyond marriage and Holy Orders, the Church recognizes other forms
of covenant love. Religious brothers and sisters take vows of poverty,
chastity, and obedience, creating a covenant bond with God through
their religious community. Their vows follow the same covenant
pattern—permanent commitment, exclusive dedication, fruitful mis-
sion, and sacred reality.

Consecrated virgins, one of the most ancient forms of consecrated
life, enter into a spousal covenant with Christ Himself. Through

                                  165
Chapter 8 The Sacraments


their consecration, they become living signs of the Church as Bride
of Christ, demonstrating that human hearts are ultimately made for
God alone.

These vocations remind us that covenant love takes many forms, but
always involves the same essential elements: permanent commitment,
self-gift, and ordering one’s life for the good of others and the glory
of God.


8.10      All Vocations Called to Covenant
          Love
Every authentic vocation—whether marriage, priesthood, religious
life, or any professional calling—is ultimately a response to God’s in-
vitation to participate in His perfect love. The teacher who dedicates
herself to forming young minds, the doctor who heals the sick, the
lawyer who defends justice, the scientist who seeks truth, the engineer
who builds for human flourishing—all are called to live out covenant
love in their particular sphere of service.

Living Professional Covenant Love:

Every profession offers unique opportunities to practice the four pil-
lars of perfect love:

  • Truth: Pursuing excellence and honesty in your field, refusing
    to compromise integrity for personal gain
  • Justice: Using your skills and position to serve the common
    good, especially the most vulnerable
  • Mercy: Showing compassion to colleagues, clients, and com-
    petitors, especially when they fail
  • Sacrifice: Offering your talents and time for others’ benefit,
    not just personal advancement
  • Covenant: Living in a permanent, exclusive, fruitful, and sa-
    cred relationship with God and others

The Integration of All Vocations:

Professional vocations don’t compete with marriage, priesthood, or

                                 166
                                               Chapter 8 The Sacraments


religious life—they complement and serve them. The married teacher
brings the love learned in family life to the classroom. The priest-
scientist uses his celibate heart to pursue truth for all humanity. The
religious sister-doctor combines her vows with her medical training to
serve the poorest patients.

All authentic vocations ultimately serve the same goal: building up
the Kingdom of God through covenant love. Whether changing di-
apers or performing surgery, celebrating Mass or teaching calculus,
taking vows or taking depositions—every vocation becomes a path to
holiness when lived as covenant response to God’s perfect love.


8.11 How Covenant Enables Perfect Love
Within the secure bonds of covenant, all the facets of perfect love find
their fulfillment:

Truth flourishes because covenant creates the safety needed for
complete honesty. We can risk being fully known because we are
permanently loved. God’s truth, revealed in creation and Scripture,
becomes not a threat but a gift—the foundation for authentic rela-
tionship.

Justice is restored because covenant provides the patience needed
to work through conflicts without abandonment. We can face our
failures and make amends because the relationship endures. God’s
justice, written on our hearts, becomes not condemnation but the
path to healing.

Mercy is multiplied because covenant assures us that forgiveness
will not be exploited. We can extend radical mercy because we trust
in permanent commitment. God’s mercy, promised in Scripture, be-
comes not weakness but the power that transforms hearts.

Sacrifice is meaningful because covenant guarantees that our gifts
are investments in eternal relationships. We can pour out our lives
because we know they will bear lasting fruit. God’s sacrifice, demon-
strated in Christ’s death, becomes not loss but the victory that con-
quers every evil.

Chapter 8 The Sacraments


8.12       Daily Covenant Living - Make your
           life a living sacrament!
God does not command this love from on high. He does not demand
it as a tyrant. Instead, He humbly invites us into His own covenant
love. He shows us “the way” by walking it Himself—speaking truth
in love, executing justice with mercy, sacrificing everything on the
Cross, remaining faithful to His covenant even when we break ours.

This is His invitation to you—not a burden but a liberation, not a
command but a call: “If anyone would come after me, let him deny
himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save
his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it”
(Matthew 16:24-25).

This is the paradox and the promise: In losing ourselves through
covenant love that integrates truth, justice, mercy, and sacrifice, we
find our true nature, calling and meaning in the gift of our life. In
dying to selfishness, we are born to authentic love. In taking up our
cross, we discover resurrection - we are “born again”.

Even our final earthly act—death itself—can be consecrated within
our covenant with God through the Sacrament of Anointing of the
Sick. This beautiful sacrament offers us the grace to transform our dy-
ing into a final act of covenant love, uniting our suffering with Christ’s
passion and preparing our souls for the eternal covenant in heaven.
Through anointing with holy oil and the prayers of the Church, God
enables us to love perfectly even in our most vulnerable moments,
ensuring that not even death can separate us from His covenant love.

Daily Covenant Fidelity: - Begin each day by renewing your bap-
tismal promises - Choose commitment over convenience in small deci-
sions - Support others in their covenant relationships through prayer
and practical help - Receive the Eucharist frequently, ideally daily, to
draw strength for all your relationships - Celebrate the Sacrament of
Reconciliation regularly (weekly or monthly) to maintain communion
with God - When you fail, return quickly to Reconciliation to restore
communion—don’t let guilt accumulate - Witness to God’s covenant
love through faithfulness in all relationships

Vocational Covenant Living: - Married: Renew your wedding
vows daily through loving choices, model covenant fidelity for your
children - Single: Practice covenant love in friendship as preparation
for marriage or religious life - Parents: Raise children to understand
that authentic love requires permanent commitment, not just feel-
ings - Priests: Embrace celibacy as spousal love for the Church,
seek spiritual direction when struggling - Professionals: Live out
your profession as a covenant response to God’s perfect love - All:
Remember that covenant failures don’t break permanent bonds but
create barriers to communion

Covenant Witness in the World: - Defend the truth about mar-
riage and family in a culture that attacks both - Pray for those in
covenant relationships, especially those facing diﬀiculties - Welcome
those seeking to restore broken covenant relationships - Make every re-
lationship an opportunity to practice covenant fidelity - Break cycles
of broken love in your family and community

Daily Examination: Each evening, ask yourself: “How did I live
covenant love today? Where did I choose commitment over conve-
nience? How can I grow in faithfulness tomorrow?”

Lord Jesus Christ, You are the perfect covenant keeper, establishing
the New Covenant through Your death and resurrection. Thank You
for calling us into covenant relationship with You through Baptism and
providing the Eucharist as our covenant renewal. Grant us the grace
to live covenant love in all our relationships—permanent, faithful, and
ordered toward life-giving communion. When we fail in our covenant
commitments, draw us quickly to Reconciliation to restore communion
within our permanent bonds. Help us to break cycles of broken love
and create legacies of authentic covenant love for the salvation of the
world. Through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.


8.13 Examen: Living Covenant Love
Evening Reflection: 1. Gratitude: How did God strengthen my
covenant relationships today through the sacraments and daily grace?
2. Examination: Where did I choose convenience over commitment,

                                 169
Chapter 8 The Sacraments


self-interest over covenant love? Am I participating in the sacraments
regularly—especially the Eucharist and Reconciliation? 3. Sorrow:
How did my failures in covenant love harm my relationships or spiri-
tual life? 4. Resolution: What specific act of covenant fidelity will I
offer tomorrow? 5. Prayer: Ask for the grace to live the integration
of truth, justice, mercy, sacrifice, and covenant in all relationships.

Daily Practice: Before making decisions, ask: “How does this choice
serve my covenant commitments? What does integrated love require
here?” Let covenant fidelity guide your choices rather than conve-
nience, options, or self-interest.

Act of Contrition: “O my God, I am heartily sorry for having of-
fended You, and I detest all my sins because of Your just punishments,
but most of all because they offend You, my God, who are all-good
and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of Your
grace, to sin no more and to avoid the near occasions of sin. Amen.”

              Chapter 9 The Cross and Resurrection - Perfect Love Incarnate


9.1     The Moment That Changed Every-
        thing
There is a moment in human history when perfect love became visible.
Not as an abstract concept or beautiful ideal, but as flesh and blood
poured out on a wooden cross and raised to glorious life on Easter
morning. There, in the complete Paschal Mystery—Christ’s passion,
death, and resurrection—Jesus Christ demonstrated what we have
been exploring throughout this entire book: that authentic love is
not a single virtue but the perfect integration of all virtues—truth,
justice, mercy, sacrifice, and covenant—blazing forth in perfect unity
and ultimate victory.

Every facet of love we have examined finds its ultimate expression and
fulfillment in Christ’s Paschal Mystery. The Cross reveals love’s depth
and willingness to sacrifice; the Resurrection reveals love’s power and
ultimate triumph. Together, they show us why the Eucharist is truly
the “source and summit” of our faith—because it makes present the
very moment when perfect love conquered all evil, opened the gates
of heaven, and continues to transform the world through resurrection
power today.

      The Cross reveals love’s perfect sacrifice; the Resurrection
      reveals love’s perfect victory. Together they manifest per-
      fect love.



9.2     How Adults Make the Cross Clear to
        Children
Unlike the natural virtues we explored in previous chapters, the Cross
and Resurrection represent revealed truths that children cannot un-
derstand instinctively. The mystery of God’s love poured out for our
salvation must be taught, explained, and most importantly, lived
out by the adults who love them.

Research shows that children’s fundamental worldview—including
their understanding of how love works—is formed between ages 18

                                  175
Chapter 9 The Cross and Resurrection - Perfect Love Incarnate


months and 13 years. This means we have roughly 12 years to lay the
foundation for a child’s capacity to understand and receive authentic
love. The quality of human love children experience during these
critical years shapes their ability to comprehend divine love for the
rest of their lives.


This is why our understanding of perfect love is so crucial—not just for
our own spiritual growth, but for our mission as parents, teachers, and
mentors. When we truly understand what love means, we can help
children grasp the profound mystery of the Paschal Mystery through
our own lived witness:


When we make sacrifices for our children, they begin to under-
stand that love sometimes requires giving up what we want for the
good of others. When we forgive those who hurt us, children see
that mercy is stronger than revenge. When we keep our promises
even when it’s diﬀicult, children learn that covenant love is per-
manent. When we live the sacramental life faithfully, children
encounter the fruits of the Cross and Resurrection in their daily ex-
perience. When we speak truth with love, children learn that
authentic love never compromises with evil but always seeks the good
of the other.


This is our sacred responsibility: to live the perfect love revealed in
the Paschal Mystery so authentically that children can see, through
our imperfect but sincere efforts, what God’s perfect love looks like.
We become living explanations of the Cross and Resurrection, making
visible through our daily choices the same integration of truth, justice,
mercy, sacrifice, and covenant that Jesus demonstrated on Calvary
and validated through His victory over death.


For a detailed exploration of how children’s minds and hearts develop
the capacity to understand divine love, and why the early years are so
crucial for spiritual formation, see the Appendix: “How Adults Make
Divine Love Clear to Children.”

              Chapter 9 The Cross and Resurrection - Perfect Love Incarnate


9.3     The Cross: Where All Love’s Facets
        Converge
On the Cross, every element of our definition of perfect love—“the
sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant, binding truth, justice, and mercy,
gathering us into life-giving communion”—blazes forth in perfect
unity:


9.4     Sacred Love Revealed
Remember, “God is love”. He created love and our ability to love is
a gift from Him. It can be said that love is “super-natural” because
it is not something created by the natural world. Rocks do not love.

The Cross reveals love’s ultimate sacred dimension. Here we see that
Jesus is not merely a good man dying for a cause, but God Himself
pouring out His life for humanity. As St. Paul declares: “In him
the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily” (Colossians 2:9). The Cross
is sacred because it shows us God’s own love in action—the Father
giving His Son, the Son offering Himself, the Holy Spirit making it
all possible.

This changes everything. We are not just forgiven by a human teacher
but loved by God Himself - the author of justice. We are not just
inspired by a good example but actually transformed by God’s power.
We are not just offered human sympathy but invited to share in God’s
own life.

Christ’s love on the Cross also reveals how precious every human
person is to God. Every person—from the greatest saint to the most
hardened sinner—is worth God’s own life. This is why every human
life matters so much, why marriage is so important, why every act of
authentic love connects us to God Himself.


9.5     Sacrificial Love Perfected
The Cross is the ultimate expression of sacrificial love. Here we see
love proven not by words or feelings but by the complete gift of self

                                  177
Chapter 9 The Cross and Resurrection - Perfect Love Incarnate


unto death. Jesus demonstrates what He taught: “Greater love has
no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends” (John
15:13).

But Christ’s sacrifice goes beyond even this supreme standard—He
died not just for His friends but for His enemies: “But God shows
his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us”
(Romans 5:8). This perfectly fulfills His own teaching: “But I say to
you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that
you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven” (Matthew 5:44-45).
This is sacrificial love perfected: choosing the good of others even
when they reject, mock, and crucify you.

The sacrificial nature of the Cross also reveals the pattern for all
authentic love. Every true act of love requires some form of sacrifice—
putting another’s good before our own immediate desires. Parents
sacrifice sleep for their children. Spouses sacrifice their individual
preferences, goals, dreams for their the good of the marriage covenant.
Friends sacrifice time and energy for each other. Priests sacrifice
marriage and family for their spiritual children. All authentic love
follows the pattern established on Calvary.


9.6     The Gift Freely Given
The Cross reveals love as pure gift. Christ’s sacrifice was not earned,
demanded, or deserved. It was freely given out of love alone. As
St. Paul marvels: “He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up
for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?”
(Romans 8:32).

This gift dimension is crucial because it reveals that authentic love
cannot be bought, manipulated, or coerced. Love that must be earned
isn’t love at all—it’s a transaction. Love that can be demanded isn’t
love—it’s obligation. Love that can be forced isn’t love—it’s violence.

The Cross shows us that God’s love is pure gift, and therefore all au-
thentic human love must also be freely given. If the gift is not offered,
there is no love. This is why forced marriage isn’t marriage, why co-
erced charity isn’t charity, why manipulated affection isn’t affection.

              Chapter 9 The Cross and Resurrection - Perfect Love Incarnate


True love can only be offered as gift and received as gift.

Love as Response, Not Transaction

This gift dimension reveals a beautiful truth: we do not love God in
order to get to heaven. Rather, we love God because He first loved
us. As St. John declares: “We love because he first loved us” (1 John
4:19).

The Cross demonstrates that our relationship with God is His free
gift to us—we cannot earn it, buy it, or deserve it. This means our
response of love is not a transaction but a grateful response to the
love already freely given. We love God not to accomplish something
to offer our gift back to Him.

This transforms everything. When we understand that God’s love is
pure gift, our love becomes pure response. We don’t serve God to
earn His favor—we already have His favor through Christ’s sacrifice.
We don’t obey His commandments to achieve something—we obey be-
cause we’re already His beloved children. We don’t practice virtue to
become worthy—we practice virtue because we’ve been made worthy
through Christ’s blood.

This understanding liberates us to love authentically and abundantly.
We’re not constantly anxious about whether we’ve done enough to
earn God’s love. Instead, we’re free to love because we know we’re
already perfectly loved. Our spiritual life becomes a joyful response
to being loved first.

Through this relationship of love—God loving us first and we learning
to love Him in return—we are saved from the evil in our own hearts.
We learn how to love one another and even ourselves properly. This
is the love that saves the world, as Jesus declared:

     For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son,
     that whoever believes in him should not perish but have
     eternal life. And this is the judgment: the light has come
     into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than
     the light because their works were evil. But whoever does
     what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly
     seen that his works have been carried out in God.

Chapter 9 The Cross and Resurrection - Perfect Love Incarnate


      — John 3:16, 20-21


9.7     Covenant Love Established
On the Cross, Jesus establishes the New Covenant in His blood: “This
cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood”
(Luke 22:20). This is not a temporary arrangement or conditional
contract but an eternal, unbreakable covenental bond between God
and humanity.

The covenant dimension of the Cross reveals love’s permanent nature.
God’s love for us is not dependent on our performance, our feelings,
or our circumstances. It is grounded in His unchanging nature and
sealed by Christ’s blood. As St. Paul declares: “I am sure that neither
death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things
to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all
creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ
Jesus our Lord” (Romans 8:38-39).

This covenant love becomes the model for all human relationships.
Through Baptism, we enter into the fundamental covenant with God
that makes all other covenant relationships possible. The Eucharist
continually renews and deepens this covenant bond, as we receive
Christ’s own Body and Blood—the same sacrifice offered on the Cross.
Through the Sacrament of Reconciliation, we return to covenant love
when we have broken it through sin, experiencing God’s mercy and
justice united in forgiveness. Marriage is meant to reflect this per-
manent, faithful love. Priesthood is a covenant commitment to serve
God’s people. Religious life is a covenant of total consecration. Even
friendship, when authentic, creates bonds that endure through diﬀi-
culties and changes.


9.8     True Justice and True Mercy United
The Cross shows us how true justice and true mercy work together
as one. They cannot be separated because they are both essential
parts of authentic love. God doesn’t just ignore our wrongdoing or

                                    180
              Chapter 9 The Cross and Resurrection - Perfect Love Incarnate


pretend it doesn’t matter. True love demands that wrongs be made
right, that evil be stopped, and that the proper order be restored. On
the Cross, Christ makes everything right by taking upon Himself the
consequences we deserved.

As Isaiah prophesied: “But he was pierced for our transgressions; he
was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that
brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed” (Isaiah 53:5).
Christ doesn’t throw out justice—He fulfills it completely. He gives
to God what love truly requires: perfect faithfulness. He gives to
humanity what love truly offers: freedom from the power of sin.

But simultaneously, the Cross reveals perfect mercy. Even as justice
is satisfied, mercy goes beyond what is due to offer forgiveness and
healing. Here we witness the most profound demonstration of God’s
mercy: Christ’s prayer from the Cross—“Father, forgive them, for
they know not what they do” (Luke 23:34)—extends forgiveness to
those committing the most egregious crime imaginable: crucifying
the Son of God, crucifying God Himself.

Think about this: if Jesus can forgive even this ultimate sin—the mur-
der of God incarnate—then He can forgive any sin at all. The Cross
proves that no sin is too great for God’s mercy when we simply ask
for forgiveness and love Him in return. This is why the Church opens
every Mass with the Confiteor (“I confess to almighty God and
to you, my brothers and sisters, that I have greatly sinned”)
and the Kyrie Eleison (“Lord, have mercy”) offers confession for
all who have sinned against God or neighbor in order to receive full
mercy so that they can be truly healed.

True Healing, Not Just Legal Declaration

But Christ’s work on the Cross goes far deeper than simply wiping
sin from a ledger or having a judge declare us righteous. Jesus died
for our sins so that we can be healed and so that we can bring
others to healing. Through seeing His full justice and full mercy, we
can actually be healed from the injustice we have done toward God
and neighbor.

We are real people with body, mind, and soul who need true healing.

                                  181
Chapter 9 The Cross and Resurrection - Perfect Love Incarnate


Sin doesn’t just create legal guilt—it wounds our consciences with
guilt, shame, anger and desires for revenge or worse. It damages our
ability to trust, to love, and to receive love. It creates barriers in our
relationships with God and others.

Christ’s perfect justice and mercy on the Cross heals these real
wounds. When we see His justice, our consciences are cleansed from
guilt because we know justice has been satisfied. When we see His
mercy, our hearts are freed from shame because we know we are
truly forgiven. When we see His love for enemies, we are liberated
from revenge and anger because we learn to love as He loves.

This healing enables us to be truly open and available to God’s full
love and the full love of others. We don’t just receive a legal pardon—
we receive the actual capacity to love God with our whole heart, mind,
soul, and strength, and to love our neighbor as ourselves. We are
made whole again and able to love others as God loves us.

Learning Superior Justice and Mercy

When we begin to grasp how Christ’s love enables true justice and
mercy, we learn how to love others in the same way. He teaches us
to give others their proper honor, respect, obedience, truth— what
authentic love is truly about. Christ shows us how to love with a
superior justice and mercy that goes far beyond what our human
hearts intuitively know.

This is why “faith” (meaning “trust” in God’s perfect love) is a su-
pernatural gift. As St. Paul explains:

      For by grace you have been saved through faith. And
      this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a
      result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are
      his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works,
      which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in
      them.

     — Ephesians 2:8-10

It is by His Grace (His Perfect Love) that we are saved through trust-
ing His Perfect Love, and for what purpose? To recognize that we

                                    182
               Chapter 9 The Cross and Resurrection - Perfect Love Incarnate


were created for a sacred purpose - to love God and our neighbor as
ourselves.

Our fallen nature tends to lead us toward what is good for us—self-
preservation, self-advancement, self-protection. But God’s love leads
us toward what is good for others, even when it costs us something.

      Faith—this trust in God’s perfect love—is itself an act
      of justice, giving God the honor and trust He deserves
      because of all He has done to love us.

When we truly believe in Christ, we are not just accepting a doctrine—
we are entering into the New Covenant, beginning a life of discipleship
where we learn to become love as He is love. Faith opens our hearts
to see others as God sees them: beloved children worth dying for,
deserving of proper justice tempered by mercy, worthy of truth spoken
in love.

This faith naturally flows into the complete work of love—serving
others, practicing mercy, seeking justice, speaking truth, making sac-
rifices. Faith cannot be separated from these works because authentic
faith is trust in God’s love, and trust in love naturally expresses itself
through loving action. Through this living faith that works through
love, we are drawn away from the sinful life that destroys and toward
God’s perfect love that gives life. This is the love that saves the world.

This mercy is not weakness or compromise with evil. It is strength
that chooses reconciliation over revenge, healing over punishment,
restoration over destruction. Christ’s mercy on the Cross doesn’t
excuse sin—it conquers sin. It doesn’t ignore evil—it transforms evil
into good.

The perfect unity of justice and mercy revealed on the Cross becomes
the pattern for all authentic love. We are called to uphold justice
while extending mercy, to speak truth while offering forgiveness, to
maintain moral standards while welcoming repentant sinners. This
doesn’t mean ignoring justice or enabling evil, but following Christ’s
example of love that holds justice and mercy in perfect tension.

                                   183
Chapter 9 The Cross and Resurrection - Perfect Love Incarnate


9.9     Life-Giving Communion Created
The Cross creates life-giving communion between God and humanity.
Through Christ’s death and resurrection, the barriers created by sin
are removed, and we are invited into intimate relationship with God.
As St. Paul explains: “All this is from God, who reconciled us to
himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation” (2
Corinthians 5:18).

This communion is not just individual but communal. The Cross cre-
ates the Church—the Body of Christ—where all believers are united
in one family. It breaks down the walls that divide us: “There is nei-
ther Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male
and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:28).

The life-giving nature of the Cross is also literal—it conquers death
itself. Through His resurrection, Christ opens the gates of eternal
life, transforming death from an ending into a beginning. Every au-
thentic act of love participates in this life-giving power, creating new
possibilities, new hope, new life.


9.10       Why the Cross and Resurrection Re-
           veal Perfect Love
The Cross and Resurrection together reveal perfect love because they
integrate all love’s facets without compromise or contradiction. Of-
ten in human experience, we must choose between justice and mercy,
between truth and compassion, between sacrifice and wisdom. But in
the Paschal Mystery, Christ holds all these virtues in perfect tension
while demonstrating love’s ultimate victory:

Perfect Truth and Perfect Mercy: The Cross reveals the truth
about human sin (we are guilty and deserve death) and the truth
about divine love (God loves us enough to die for us). The Resurrec-
tion reveals the truth about love’s power (it conquers death itself) and
mercy’s extent (it transforms us completely). Christ doesn’t minimize
our guilt or exaggerate God’s love—He shows both in their fullness
and then demonstrates love’s power to transform everything.

                                    184
              Chapter 9 The Cross and Resurrection - Perfect Love Incarnate


Perfect Justice and Perfect Mercy: The Cross satisfies justice
completely (sin is punished) while extending mercy completely (sin-
ners are forgiven). The Resurrection shows that this justice and mercy
create new life—we are not just pardoned but transformed. Christ
doesn’t compromise justice for mercy or limit mercy for justice—He
fulfills both perfectly and then elevates us beyond what either could
accomplish alone.



Perfect Sacrifice and Perfect Victory: The Cross shows the ulti-
mate sacrifice (Christ’s life) while the Resurrection accomplishes the
ultimate victory (conquering sin and death). Christ doesn’t waste His
life in meaningless suffering—He transforms suffering into salvation
and death into eternal life. The Resurrection proves that sacrificial
love is not just noble but victorious.



Perfect Covenant and Perfect Freedom: The Cross establishes
an eternal covenant (unbreakable bond with God) while the Resurrec-
tion demonstrates this covenant’s life-giving power. Christ respects
human freedom (we can accept or reject His gift) while offering the
grace to choose love freely. He doesn’t force love or make covenant
conditional—He offers permanent relationship that transforms our
very capacity to love.



Perfect Suffering and Perfect Glory: The Cross shows love’s
willingness to suffer, while the Resurrection shows love’s power to
transform suffering into glory. This reveals that authentic love doesn’t
just endure diﬀiculties—it transforms them into sources of new life
and hope.



This perfect integration across the entire Paschal Mystery is what
makes the Cross and Resurrection the ultimate revelation of love.
It shows us what love looks like when it is complete, mature, fully
realized, and ultimately victorious.

9.11       The Cross and Every Human Rela-
           tionship
The Cross doesn’t just reveal God’s love—it establishes the pattern
for all authentic human love. Recall that Jesus came down to earth
- to teach us how to love here “on earth as it is in heaven”. Every
relationship, every commitment, every act of love must follow the
pattern established on Calvary:

Marriage: Spouses are called to love as Christ loved the Church—
with sacred, sacrificial, covenantal love that integrates justice and
mercy into life-giving communion. The wedding vows echo Christ’s
commitment: “for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness
and in health, until death do us part.”

Parenthood: Parents are called to love their children with the same
sacrificial love Christ showed—willing to lay down their lives for their
children’s good, extending mercy while maintaining justice, creating
secure covenant bonds that enable children to flourish.

Priesthood: Priests are called to love their spiritual children as
Christ loved the Church—offering their lives as sacrifice, extending
mercy while upholding truth, creating covenant bonds that serve the
salvation of souls.

Friendship: True friends love with something of the same pattern—
willing to sacrifice for each other’s good, extending mercy while speak-
ing truth, creating bonds that endure through diﬀiculties.

All Relationships: Every authentic relationship must include ele-
ments of the Cross—some form of giving people their proper honor,
some extension of mercy, some commitment to truth, some covenant
bond that creates security for love to flourish.

Common Good of Society: The Cross also reveals the pattern
for social love. Communities, nations, and institutions are called
to reflect Christ’s love by promoting justice, extending mercy, and
creating life-giving structures that enable all people to flourish. This
means working for the common good, defending human dignity, and
building a culture of authentic love.

              Chapter 9 The Cross and Resurrection - Perfect Love Incarnate


9.12 The Resurrection: Love’s Ultimate
     Victory
But the Cross is not the end of the story—it leads to the Resurrection,
which completes and validates the revelation of perfect love. The
Cross alone shows God’s willingness to suffer and die for us, but
the Resurrection proves that this love is victorious and life-giving.
Without the Resurrection, the Cross would be merely noble suffering;
with it, the Cross becomes the triumph of love over death itself.

As the Catechism declares: “The Resurrection of Jesus is the crowning
truth of our faith in Christ” (CCC 638). It is not just an epilogue to
the Cross but the completion of love’s revelation. The Cross reveals
love’s depth—how far God will go to love us, even unto death. The
Resurrection reveals love’s power—that this divine love is stronger
than death itself and capable of transforming everything it touches.


9.13 Love That Creates New Life
The Resurrection demonstrates that God’s love doesn’t just forgive
sin but conquers death—the ultimate consequence of sin. Christ’s glo-
rified body shows that love transforms us completely, not just legally
but ontologically. We receive new life, not just pardoned old life.
This reveals that God’s love is creative and regenerative, not merely
merciful.

As St. Paul explains, Christ’s risen body “is filled with the power
of the Holy Spirit: he shares the divine life in his glorious state”
(CCC 646). This is why St. Paul calls Christ “the man of heaven”—
the Resurrection shows love’s power to elevate human nature itself.
When God loves, He doesn’t just sympathize with our condition—He
transforms it.

The Resurrection reveals that God’s love is not just restorative (bring-
ing us back to where we were) but creative (making us something
entirely new). This is the pattern for all authentic love: it should
create new life, new possibilities, new hope—not just solve problems
or repair damage.

                                  187
Chapter 9 The Cross and Resurrection - Perfect Love Incarnate


9.14       Love’s Eternal Dimension
The Cross shows love’s willingness to sacrifice; the Resurrection shows
love’s eternal permanence. Christ’s risen body belongs “henceforth
only to the Father’s divine realm” (CCC 645), showing that divine
love transcends time and space. This proves that the covenant love
established on the Cross is truly eternal, not just a temporary ar-
rangement.

      “By means of touch and the sharing of a meal, the risen
      Jesus establishes direct contact with his disciples. He in-
      vites them in this way to recognize that he is not a ghost
      and above all to verify that the risen body in which he
      appears to them is the same body that had been tortured
      and crucified, for it still bears the traces of his Passion.
      Yet at the same time this authentic, real body possesses
      the new properties of a glorious body: not limited by space
      and time but able to be present how and when he wills;
      for Christ’s humanity can no longer be confined to earth,
      and belongs henceforth only to the Father’s divine realm.
      For this reason too the risen Jesus enjoys the sovereign
      freedom of appearing as he wishes: in the guise of a gar-
      dener or in other forms familiar to his disciples, precisely
      to awaken their faith.”

     — Catechism of the Catholic Church 645

The Resurrection establishes that perfect love is not bound by the
limitations of earthly existence. Christ’s glorified humanity enjoys
“the sovereign freedom of appearing as he wishes” (CCC 645), demon-
strating that love, when perfected, transcends all barriers and limi-
tations. This is why the covenant established in Christ’s blood is
unbreakable—it participates in the eternal life of God Himself.

We are united - we experience an eternal union with Christ here on
earth through the sacraments which also unites us to Him forever in
heaven.

      Thy Kingdom Come. Thy Will Be Done. On Earth as it
      is in Heaven.

                                    188
              Chapter 9 The Cross and Resurrection - Perfect Love Incarnate


9.15 Our Participation in Perfect Love
Through the Resurrection, Christ enables us to share in the divine
life and gives us the actual capacity to love as God loves, not just the
example or forgiveness. This is why the Eucharist makes the entire
Paschal Mystery present—both death and resurrection are needed for
the full gift of divine love.

The Resurrection proves that perfect love is not just an impossible
ideal but an achievable reality. Through Christ’s grace, we can ac-
tually live the integrated love we have been exploring. We can be
people of truth and mercy, justice and compassion, sacrifice and wis-
dom, covenant and freedom.

The Pattern for Human Love: Just as human love must follow
the Cross pattern (sacrifice), it must also follow the Resurrection
pattern (hope and transformation). Every authentic act of love should
participate in the life-giving power of the Resurrection, creating new
possibilities and bringing hope into seemingly hopeless situations.

     What would it mean if the world practiced God’s Perfect
     Love?


9.16 Examen: Perfect Love Incarnate
Evening Reflection: 1. Gratitude: How did I encounter Christ’s
perfect love today through the Eucharist, Scripture, or other people?
2. Examination: Where did I fail to love with the integration of
truth, justice, mercy, sacrifice, and covenant that Christ showed on
the Cross? 3. Sorrow: How did my imperfect love harm my relation-
ships or fail to witness to Christ’s perfect love? 4. Resolution: What
specific way will I imitate Christ’s perfect love tomorrow? 5. Prayer:
Ask for the grace to love as Christ loved, with perfect integration of
all love’s facets.

Daily Practice: Before making decisions, ask: “How would Christ’s
love on the Cross guide this choice? What does perfect love require
here?” Let the Cross be your standard for authentic love in all rela-
tionships and situations.

10.1 The Night Everything Changed
The Passion of the Lord did not begin on Good Friday. It began the
night before, in an upper room in Jerusalem, when Jesus gathered
His disciples for what would become the most important meal in
human history. There, at the Last Supper, Jesus began to reveal
the full meaning of everything we have been exploring about perfect
love. Through His entire Passion—the Last Supper, His death, burial,
resurrection, and ascension—He showed His disciples and us exactly
how the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant love would bind truth,
justice, and mercy, gathering us into life-giving communion.

That night, Jesus did something that seemed impossible: He made
His future sacrifice on the Cross present to His disciples before it
even happened. He took bread and wine and said: “This is my body,
which is given for you… This cup that is poured out for you is the
new covenant in my blood” (Luke 22:19-20). In that moment, Jesus
established the Eucharist—the way His perfect love would remain
present with us always.

But to understand why Jesus chose this particular night, this partic-
ular meal, and these particular words, we need to see how everything
in Scripture had been pointing toward this moment.


10.2 Fulfilling the Law and the Prophets
When Jesus said, “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law
or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them”
(Matthew 5:17), He was revealing something profound about love.

story—was ultimately about love. As Jesus later explained, “All the
Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments”: love God
with all your heart, soul, and mind, and love your neighbor as yourself
(Matthew 22:40).

The perfect love we have been defining throughout this book—the
sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant, binding truth, justice, and mercy,
gathering us into life-giving communion—this is what the entire Old
Testament was pointing toward. Every sacrifice, every covenant, every
act of justice and mercy was preparing humanity to recognize and
receive this perfect love when it appeared.

The Passover Pattern: The most important preparation was the
Passover. Every year, the Jewish people remembered how God deliv-
ered them from slavery in Egypt through the sacrifice of an unblem-
ished lamb. The lamb’s blood marked their doorposts, and death
“passed over” their homes. But the sacrifice wasn’t complete until
the lamb was eaten—the family had to consume the sacrifice to re-
ceive its benefits.

This wasn’t just a historical memory—it was a pattern pointing to-
ward something greater. The Passover lamb had to be: - Male (sym-
bolizing Christ’s masculinity) - Unblemished (perfect and without
sin) - Sacrificed (its blood shed for protection) - Consumed (eaten
to complete the sacrifice)

Jesus, the “Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world” (John
1:29), would fulfill this pattern perfectly.



10.3      The Last Supper: Establishing the
          New Covenant
Jesus deliberately chose the Passover meal to reveal the full meaning
of His mission. This wasn’t coincidence—it was the fulfillment of
everything the Passover had been pointing toward for over a thousand
years.

                                   194
                     Chapter 10 The Eucharist - Perfect Love Made Present


The Context of Love
At the Last Supper, Jesus was surrounded by His disciples—the men
He had loved, taught, and served for three years.

     “Now before the festival of the Passover, Jesus knew that
     his hour had come to depart from this world and go to
     the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world,
     he loved them to the end.”

     — John 13:1

This meal was the ultimate expression of covenant love—Jesus bind-
ing Himself permanently to those He loved.

But this wasn’t just human affection. This was the perfect love of
God being poured out in a way that would make His one true sacrifice
available to every person for all time. Jesus was establishing a New
Covenant—not replacing the old one, but fulfilling it completely.

We often take this for granted: Jesus was born of Mary, walked on
this earth, ate with sinners, and loved these twelve disciples deeply.
All of this reveals how Jesus was fulfilling the Law and the Prophets—
He desires true communion with us, authentic relationship with us.
He knows that for us to be fully alive, we must be fully alive in our
relationship with Him. Yet He doesn’t impose this as a divine decree
from above. Instead, He invites us to follow Him voluntarily, just as
each of the twelve disciples chose to do. He invites us to sit at His
feet and learn from Him. He invites us to discover the depth and
breadth of His love so that we can learn to love in truth, justice, and
mercy—not for our own sake alone, but to be “the light of the world”
and “the salt of the earth” through total communion with Him and
with each other.

If the Cross alone had been the Father’s only purpose for His Son,
then Jesus wouldn’t have needed to undertake three years of earthly
ministry—touching lives, elevating the understanding of love through
the Beatitudes, teaching us to pray, proclaiming the Sermon on the
Mount, and directly healing those who needed restoration of body,
mind, and soul. If we don’t grasp the entire Passion of the Lord—from

                                 195
Chapter 10 The Eucharist - Perfect Love Made Present


the Last Supper through His Death, Resurrection, and Ascension—
we miss the complete picture of how Jesus fulfilled the Law and the
Prophets.

This is why the Church’s liturgical seasons are so profound: they
guide us through the complete mystery of Christ’s perfect love. The
entire Passion unfolds through our liturgical year, culminating in the
Sacred Triduum and flowing into the joy of Easter, which reaches its
fulfillment at Pentecost:

The Complete Paschal Mystery: - Preparation for the Pas-
sion (Lent) - The Passion Itself (Holy Week and Sacred Triduum) -
The Resurrection in Fullness (Easter Octave) - Forty Days with
the Risen Lord (Easter Season) - The Sending of the Church
(Ascension and Pentecost)


The Words That Changed Everything
When Jesus took the bread and said,

     “This is my body, which is given for you”

     — Luke 22:19

He was making present His future sacrifice on the Cross. When He
took the cup and said,

     “This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant
     in my blood”

     — Luke 22:20

He was establishing the permanent way His love would remain with
us.

These weren’t just symbolic words—they were the words of God
Himself, with the power to make present what they declared. Just
as God spoke creation into existence, Jesus spoke His sacrifice into
sacramental presence. The bread truly became His Body; the wine
truly became His Blood.

Why This Matters: Jesus wasn’t just giving us a nice memory or
a beautiful symbol. He was giving us the actual reality of His perfect

                                   196
                      Chapter 10 The Eucharist - Perfect Love Made Present


love in a form we could receive. Every time we celebrate the Eucharist,
we don’t just remember what Jesus did—we participate in the eternal
reality of His sacrifice.

     “The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation
     in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not
     a participation in the body of Christ?”

     — 1 Corinthians 10:16


10.4 John 6: The Promise Fulfilled
Months before the Last Supper, Jesus had prepared His disciples for
this moment. Take a few minutes and read the entire chapter of John
6. After the miracles of feeding the five thousand and walking on
water, as the “Jewish feast of Passover was near” (John 6:4), Jesus
made a shocking declaration: “I am the living bread that came down
from heaven. Whoever eats of this bread will live forever; and the
bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh” (John 6:51).

Many people were scandalized by these words. They asked, “How
can this man give us his flesh to eat?” (John 6:52). But Jesus didn’t
soften His words—He made them even stronger:

     “Very truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of
     Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Those
     who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life,
     and I will raise them up on the last day.”

     — John 6:53-54

Many left him, but those that had submitted their lives to him re-
mained.

     “As a result of this, many of his disciples returned to their
     former way of life and no longer accompanied him. Je-
     sus then said to the Twelve,”Do you also want to leave?”
     Simon Peter answered him, “Master, to whom shall we
     go? You have the words of eternal life. We have come to
     believe and are convinced that you are the Holy One of

                                  197
Chapter 10 The Eucharist - Perfect Love Made Present


      God.”

     — John 6:66-69

The Connection to Perfect Love: Jesus was revealing that perfect
love isn’t just something we admire from a distance—it’s something
we must receive into ourselves. To truly live the integrated love we’ve
been exploring, we need more than good intentions or noble ideals.
We need the actual life of God within us.

When we receive the Eucharist, we receive: - Sacred Love: The very
life of God - Sacrificial Love: Christ’s perfect offering for our salva-
tion - Gift Love: Freely given, not earned or deserved - Covenant
Love: Permanent bond that nothing can break - Just and Merci-
ful Love: Perfect integration of all love’s facets - Life-giving Love:
Power to transform us and make us capable of authentic love


10.5      Good Friday:                 The Sacrifice Com-
          pleted
The next day, everything Jesus had made present at the Last Supper
was fulfilled on the Cross. There, the unblemished Lamb of God shed
His blood for the New Covenant. There, perfect love was revealed
in all its fullness—sacred, sacrificial, covenantal, just, merciful, and
life-giving.

But the Cross wasn’t separate from the Last Supper—it was the com-
pletion of what Jesus had begun the night before. The Eucharist made
the Cross present before it happened; the Cross made the Eucharist
eternally real.

The Ultimate Injustice and Perfect Mercy: The crucifixion
was the most heinous crime imaginable—killing God Himself, who in
His human nature was completely without sin. This was the ultimate
injustice, demanding the full justice of God. Yet even as this ultimate
crime was being committed, Jesus prayed, “Father, forgive them, for
they know not what they do” (Luke 23:34).

Here we see perfect justice and perfect mercy working together as one.

                                   198
                     Chapter 10 The Eucharist - Perfect Love Made Present


Justice was satisfied because the perfect sacrifice was offered. Mercy
was extended because forgiveness was given even before it was asked
for. This is what perfect love looks like—not justice versus mercy,
but justice and mercy perfectly integrated.


10.6 Easter Sunday: The Pattern Estab-
     lished
The story doesn’t end with the Cross. On Easter Sunday, the risen
Jesus appeared to His disciples and did something remarkable—He
established the pattern for how His perfect love would remain present
in the world.

In Luke 24, we read about Jesus appearing to the disciples on the
road to Emmaus. Notice the pattern:

First, Jesus explained the Scriptures:

     “Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he in-
     terpreted to them the things about himself in all the scrip-
     tures”

     — Luke 24:27

This is the Liturgy of the Word—Jesus showing how all of Scripture
points to Him and His perfect love.

Then, Jesus broke bread:

     “When he was at the table with them, he took bread,
     blessed and broke it, and gave it to them. Then their
     eyes were opened, and they recognized him”

     — Luke 24:30-31

This is the Liturgy of the Eucharist—Jesus making Himself present
through the breaking of bread.

This is the same pattern we follow in every Mass: Word and Eucharist,
Scripture and Sacrament, teaching and feeding. Jesus established this
pattern so that His perfect love would remain present and accessible
to every generation.

                                 199
Chapter 10 The Eucharist - Perfect Love Made Present


10.7      The Mass:                  Perfect Love Made
          Present
Now we can understand why the Church teaches that the Eucharist
is the “source and summit” of our faith. Every Mass makes present
the perfect love revealed in Christ’s Passion, Death, and Resurrection.
Every Mass is both Calvary and the Upper Room, both Good Friday
and Easter Sunday.


How This Actually Works
But how does a historical event from 2,000 years ago become present
today? The answer lies in understanding that God exists outside of
time. For God, the sacrifice of Jesus isn’t a past event—it’s an eternal
reality. When we celebrate Mass, we don’t travel back in time, and
Jesus doesn’t repeat His sacrifice. Instead, we are brought into the
eternal moment of His perfect love, now and today.

Think of it this way: imagine a great mountain that can be seen from
many different valleys. People in each valley see the same mountain,
even though they’re in different places. Similarly, every Mass is a
different “valley” from which we see the same eternal “mountain” of
Christ’s sacrifice.

The same God who created the entire universe makes this miracle
present to us at every Mass so that we can receive the perfect love of
God in the Eucharist and be one with Him.


The Complete Gift
In the Eucharist, we receive the complete gift of perfect love:

Sacred: We receive Christ Himself—Body, Blood, Soul, and Divin-
ity Sacrificial: We participate in His Sacrifice and also offer our
own sacrifice of thanksgiving (Eucharist literally means “Thanksgiv-
ing”) for His perfect offering to the Father Gift: It’s freely given, not
earned by our worthiness Covenant: We renew our permanent bond
with God to love Him, neighbor and self Justice: We acknowledge
our need for healing and God’s perfect righteousness Mercy: We

                                   200
                     Chapter 10 The Eucharist - Perfect Love Made Present


receive forgiveness and the power to forgive others Life-giving: We
are nourished for eternal life and strengthened for mission


Why We Must “Eat” the Sacrifice
Just as God commanded that the Passover lamb had to be consumed
to complete the sacrifice—“They shall eat the flesh that same night”
(Exodus 12:8)—we must receive the Eucharist to fully participate in
Christ’s perfect love. The blood on the doorposts provided protection,
but eating the lamb provided nourishment and full participation in
God’s deliverance. Similarly, it’s not enough to admire the Cross from
a distance or to understand it intellectually. We must allow Christ’s
perfect love to become part of us, to nourish us, to transform us from
within.

This is why Jesus was so insistent in John 6: “Unless you eat the flesh
of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you” (John
6:53). He wasn’t being dramatic—He was revealing a spiritual reality.
To live the integrated love we’ve been exploring, we need more than
human effort. We need the actual life of God within us.


10.8 The New Covenant of Love
The New Covenant established at the Last Supper and sealed on
the Cross is fundamentally a covenant of love. It’s God saying to
humanity: “I will love you with perfect love, and I will give you the
power to love Me and others with that same perfect love.”

This covenant is:

Permanent: Nothing can break it—not our failures, not our sins,
not even death Personal: It’s offered to each individual person by
name, calling us into intimate relationship with God Communal:
Yet it’s never merely private—it incorporates us into the Body of
Christ, where our personal relationship serves the good of the whole
Church Powerful: It actually transforms us, giving us the capacity
for authentic love Present: It’s available to us right now, every time
we particpate in His Mass

                                 201
Chapter 10 The Eucharist - Perfect Love Made Present


The Relationship God Wants
Through the Eucharist, we see exactly what kind of relationship God
wants with us. Not a distant, formal relationship based on arbitrary
rules and meaningless obligations, but an intimate, personal relation-
ship based on the law of love—that sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant,
binding truth, justice, and mercy, gathering us into life-giving com-
munion. God wants to be so close to us that He becomes our food,
our life, our very being.

This is the ultimate expression of the covenant love we explored earlier.
In marriage, two people become “one flesh.” In the Eucharist, we
become one with Christ Himself. This is the deepest possible union—
not just emotional or spiritual, but substantial. We literally become
what we receive.

We do this because this is exactly what Jesus told us to do. At the
Last Supper, He didn’t suggest or recommend—He commanded: “Do
this in remembrance of me” (Luke 22:19). The Church doesn’t create
this sacrament; the priest doesn’t make it happen through his own
power. This is Christ’s own sacrifice, made present through His own
words and His own promise. Just as He desired the profound union of
marriage where “two become one flesh,” He desires the same intimate
union with each of us in this New Covenant.

At every Mass, the priest acknowledges this divine command in the
Eucharistic Prayer: “ “Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memo-
rial of the saving Passion of your Son, his wondrous Resurrection and
Ascension into heaven, and as we look forward to his second coming,
we offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice… at whose
command we celebrate these mysteries.” The priest is not acting on
his own authority—he is obeying Christ’s direct command.

What looks like bread and wine to our eyes is actually the Body and
Blood of Christ, for in the sacrament of the Eucharist, Christ’s words
of institution possess the power to effect what they signify, bringing
about the real presence of His Body and Blood under the appearances
of bread and wine. When He declared “This is my body… this is my
blood” (Matthew 26:26-28), He wasn’t speaking symbolically—He was

                                   202
                      Chapter 10 The Eucharist - Perfect Love Made Present


speaking with the same creative power that said “Let there be light”
at the beginning of creation. The appearance remains the same, but
the reality has changed completely through His word and His sacrifice.

As St. Paul explains, “The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a
participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not
a participation in the body of Christ?” (1 Corinthians 10:16). This
isn’t symbolic participation—it’s real participation in Christ Himself.
When we receive Communion, we’re not just remembering Jesus or
honoring Him—we’re actually receiving His Body, Blood, Soul,
and Divinity into our own bodies, becoming one with Him just as He
desired. We are recommitting ourselves to His life-giving communion.


10.9 Living the Eucharistic Life
Understanding the Eucharist as the presence of perfect love changes
everything about how we live. We’re not just trying to be good
people—we’re learning to live as people who have received perfect
love and are called to share it with others. We participate in, submit
to, and offer our own sacrifice of thanksgiving (Eucharist literally
means “Thanksgiving”) for His perfect offering to the Father, not for
our own “boasting,” but for the sake of others, the sake of the entire
Body of Christ, the sake of the world.


Daily Transformation
Every time we receive the Eucharist, we’re being transformed more
deeply into the image of Christ. We’re receiving not just forgiveness
for our failures but the actual power to love as He loved. This is why
the saints found in daily Mass the secret to heroic love—they were
being nourished daily by perfect love itself.


The Pattern for All Love
The Eucharist also gives us the pattern for all authentic love in our
relationships:

Sacred: Every person is sacred, worthy of reverence and respect

                                  203
Chapter 10 The Eucharist - Perfect Love Made Present


Sacrificial: Love requires giving of ourselves for others’ good Gift:
Love must be freely given, not demanded or manipulated Covenant:
Love creates permanent bonds and commitments Just and Mer-
ciful: Love upholds truth while extending forgiveness Life-giving:
Love creates new possibilities and hope


Mission and Service
Finally, the Eucharist sends us out on mission. We don’t receive
Christ’s perfect love just for our own benefit but to become instru-
ments of that love in the world. The Church gives us four options for
the dismissal, each emphasizing our call to GO:

   • “Go forth, the Mass is ended” — The liturgy is complete;
     now live it
   • “Go and announce the Gospel of the Lord” — Proclaim
     what you’ve received
   • “Go in peace, glorifying the Lord by your life” — Let
     your life be your witness
   • “Go in peace” — Carry Christ’s peace to the world

Each dismissal has the same message: we’re sent to love our neighbors
with the same perfect love we just received. GO!

This is actually where the word “Mass” comes from—the Latin missa,
meaning “sent.” The Mass doesn’t end when we receive Communion;
it ends when we are sent forth to live what we have received. We are
dismissed not to go home and forget, but to go out and become living
extensions of Christ’s perfect love in the world.


10.10 For Deeper Study:                                The Lamb’s
      Supper
To explore these connections more deeply, we highly recommend Scott
Hahn’s masterful book The Lamb’s Supper: The Mass as Heaven on
Earth. Dr. Hahn, a biblical scholar and theologian, and a former
Protestant who converted to the Catholic faith, provides a detailed
exploration of how the Mass connects to the Book of Revelation and

                                   204
                      Chapter 10 The Eucharist - Perfect Love Made Present


the eternal worship of heaven. His work shows how every element of
the Mass has deep biblical roots and how the Eucharist truly makes
present the eternal reality of God’s perfect love. His book also con-
nects the New Covenant to all of the Old Testament covenants and
explains in detail how Jesus fulfills each of these covenants, showing
the magnificent unity of God’s plan of salvation throughout all of
Scripture.


10.11       The Heart of Everything
Without understanding the Eucharist as the presence of perfect love,
we miss the entire point of why Jesus was sacrificed on the Cross.
The Cross wasn’t just a historical event or a moral example—it was
the establishment of a New Covenant that makes God’s perfect love
present and available to us always.

Every time we celebrate Mass, we encounter the same perfect love
that was revealed on Calvary. We receive the same Jesus who died
and rose for us. We participate in the same sacrifice that conquered
sin and death. We are nourished by the same love that created the
universe and redeemed humanity.

This is why the Church has always taught that the Eucharist is the
center of Christian life. It’s not just one devotion among many—it’s
the source from which all authentic love flows and the summit toward
which all authentic love points. Jesus gives us His one sacrifice in the
one Mass that unites us all.

     “For just as the body is one and has many members, and
     all the members of the body, though many, are one body,
     so it is with Christ. For in one Spirit we were all baptized
     into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and we
     were all given to drink of one Spirit.”

     — 1 Corinthians 12:12-13

St. Ignatius of Antioch, writing around A.D. 107—just decades after
the apostles—understood this profound unity:

     “Take care, then, to use one Eucharist, so that whatever

                                  205
Chapter 10 The Eucharist - Perfect Love Made Present


      you do, you do according to God: for there is one flesh
      of our Lord Jesus Christ, and one cup in union with his
      blood, one altar, just as there is one bishop with the pres-
      bytery and the deacons, my fellow servants — in this way
      whatever you do is in accordance with God.”

     — St. Ignatius of Antioch, c. A.D. 107

When we truly understand this, everything changes. We see that
we’re not just trying to be “good” people—we’re learning to live as
people who have been loved with perfect love and called to share
that love with the world. We’re not just following moral rules—we’re
participating in the very life of God. We’re not just members of
an organization—we’re part of the Body of Christ, nourished by His
perfect love and sent to bring that love to every corner of the world.

Lord Jesus, thank You for establishing the New Covenant in Your
Blood and making Your perfect love present to us in the Eucharist.
Help us to understand more deeply the gift You have given us. Trans-
form us through this sacred meal so that we may become what we
receive—Your Body in the world, instruments of Your perfect love.
Give us the grace to live Eucharistic lives, offering ourselves as You
offered Yourself, loving others as You have loved us. Through Your
perfect love, make us saints who draw others to encounter You in the
Blessed Sacrament. Amen.


10.12 Examen:                      Perfect             Love   Made
      Present
Evening Reflection: 1. Gratitude: How did I encounter Christ’s
perfect love in the Eucharist today? What graces did I receive? 2.
Examination: How well did I live as someone who has received per-
fect love? Where did I fail to share this love with others? 3. Sorrow:
How did my actions or attitudes contradict the love I received in the
Eucharist? 4. Resolution: How will I better prepare to receive
Christ’s perfect love tomorrow? How will I share it more generously?
5. Prayer: Ask for the grace to live a truly Eucharistic life, centered
on Christ’s perfect love.

                     Chapter 10 The Eucharist - Perfect Love Made Present


Daily Practice: Before receiving Communion, remind yourself: “I
am about to receive perfect love itself. How will this transform me
today?” After Communion, pray: “Perfect Love, live in me and love
through me.”

movement. “How can you say that fighting against oppression is
wrong?”

I wasn’t saying that fighting against oppression was wrong. I was
trying to help her see that the ideology she had embraced—though
it contained genuine concerns about justice—was leading her away
from the very justice she sought. She wanted to fight injustice, but the
movement had taught her to see enemies everywhere, to divide people
into oppressor and oppressed categories, and to believe that hatred
of the “privileged” was actually a form of love for the “marginalized.”

This is the tragedy of our time: good hearts being captured by
counterfeit forms of love. People genuinely want justice, mercy,
truth, and authentic relationships. But they are being offered ideolo-
gies that promise these goods while delivering their opposites. The
result is not love, but division, hatred, despair, and spiritual destruc-
tion.

      Counterfeits mimic parts of love while rejecting the
      whole—separating truth, justice, or mercy from the
      others.

As Catholics who understand what authentic love truly is, we have a
responsibility to help others see through these deceptions. Not with
condemnation, but with the same sacrificial, just, and merciful love
Christ showed us when we were lost in our own forms of counterfeit
love.

Let us recall our definition of what sin is from chapter 1:

      Sin is an action that we take which chooses a perceived
      good for ourselves at the expense of others.

      Love is an action we take which chooses the good of others
      at our expense.

We can plainly see why injustice exists.

11.2      Why Counterfeits Are So Appealing
Before we examine specific counterfeits, we must understand why
they are so seductive. Every counterfeit love probably contains
some element of authentic love—that’s what makes it convincing.
Satan, as St. Augustine taught us, cannot create anything new; he
can only corrupt what God has made good.

The ideologies that capture hearts today succeed because they ap-
peal to real human needs: - The need for justice (they promise to
fight oppression) - The need for mercy (they promise compassion
for the suffering) - The need for truth (they promise to expose hid-
den realities) - The need for community (they promise belonging
and purpose) - The need for meaning (they promise to make life
significant)

The problem is not that these needs are wrong—they are
written into our hearts by God Himself. The problem is that
these ideologies offer incomplete, distorted, or even inverted versions
of what our hearts truly seek.



11.3      How Counterfeits Distort God’s Per-
          fect Love
Remember our comprehensive definition: God’s Perfect Love is
the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant, binding truth, jus-
tice, and mercy, gathering us into life-giving communion.
Counterfeit ideologies fail because they get one or more essential el-
ements of this definition wrong. Understanding these patterns helps
us recognize counterfeits and minister to those caught in them.


The Most Dangerous Error: Denying the Image of
God
The most catastrophic error—the one that leads to mass
murder and genocide—is the denial or distortion of the fun-
damental truth that all human beings are created in the

                                   210
                           Chapter 11 Counterfeit Love - What Love Is Not


image of God (Genesis 1:27). When this foundation is rejected,
humans become disposable, and love becomes impossible.

History’s greatest evils have always begun with the denial of imago
Dei: - The Holocaust: Jews were declared “subhuman” - Slavery:
Africans were treated as property rather than persons - Abortion:
Unborn children are called “clumps of cells” rather than human beings
- Communist Purges: Class enemies were deemed “enemies of the
people” unworthy of life - Ethnic Cleansing: Other tribes or races
are declared inferior or threatening

When we truly understand that every person bears God’s image, sev-
eral truths become clear: - Universal Dignity: Every person, re-
gardless of race, age, ability, or circumstance, deserves respect - In-
herent Worth: Human value comes from God, not from utility,
productivity, or social acceptance - Moral Responsibility: We are
called to reflect God’s character—truth, justice, mercy, and love -
Eternal Destiny: Each soul is created for communion with God,
making every person infinitely precious - Basis for Justice: Rights
and duties flow from our shared dignity as image-bearers - Founda-
tion for Mercy: We show mercy because we recognize God’s image
even in those who have sinned


Other Ways Counterfeits Fail Our Definition
But counterfeits don’t only fail by denying imago Dei. They can also
distort other essential elements of perfect love:

1. Rejecting the Sacred Dimension - Reducing love to mere biol-
ogy, chemistry, or “social construct” - Denying that love participates
in God’s own divine nature - Treating love as purely human rather
than a gift from God

2. Avoiding Sacrifice - Promising love without cost or commit-
ment - Seeking personal fulfillment rather than the good of the other
- Refusing the cross that authentic love requires

3. Rejecting Covenant Bonds - Treating relationships as tem-
porary and disposable - Avoiding permanent commitments and vows
- Prioritizing individual autonomy over faithful love - Rejecting the

                                 211
Chapter 11 Counterfeit Love - What Love Is Not


family consisting of one man and one woman for the pro-creation of
children for passing on our life, love and faith to future generations

4. Distorting Truth - Relativism that denies objective moral stan-
dards - Lies that call evil good and good evil - Rejecting the authority
needed to define and defend truth

5. Perverting Justice - False justice that destroys rather than
restores - Revenge disguised as justice - Utilitarian calculations that
sacrifice some for others

6. Corrupting Mercy - False mercy that enables sin rather than
healing it - Sentimentalism that avoids necessary correction - Cheap
grace that requires no repentance or transformation

7. Preventing Life-Giving Communion - Ideologies that divide
rather than unite - Systems that create enemies rather than neighbors
- Approaches that lead to isolation rather than community

Understanding these patterns helps us recognize why specific ideolo-
gies fail and how to offer authentic alternatives.

An entire book can be devoted to diving into these errors, but I think
this chapter will help you see how God’s Perfect Love is the standard
by which we can recognize and avoid these errors.



11.4      The Major Counterfeits of Our Time
1. Woke “Love”: Inclusion and Equity at All Costs
The Appeal: Woke ideology promises compassion for the marginal-
ized and liberation from any oppression. It speaks to the genuine
human need for acceptance and belonging.

The Counterfeit: Wokeism makes inclusion, equity and material
success the ultimate values [false truth], believing that any inequal-
ity of outcome proves injustice [false justice] and that love means
eliminating all differences in results regardless of other considerations
[false mercy]. It treats equal outcomes as more important than truth,
individual dignity, or authentic flourishing.

                                   212
                           Chapter 11 Counterfeit Love - What Love Is Not


What It Gets Right: - Concern for the Marginalized: Gen-
uine desire to help those who have been excluded, rejected, or treated
unfairly - Recognition of Past Injustices: Acknowledges real his-
torical wrongs like slavery, segregation, and discrimination or even
persecution - Call for Compassion: Appeals to our natural desire
to show mercy to those who are suffering - Critique of Hypocrisy:
Exposes genuine failures of Christians and institutions to live up to
their stated values - Emphasis on Inclusion: Recognizes the hu-
man need for belonging and acceptance in community - Attention to
Systemic Problems: Understands that some problems are bigger
than individual choices

What It Gets Wrong: - Distorts Imago Dei: Makes identity
categories (race, gender, sexuality) more fundamental than our
shared creation as humans beings made in God’s image [false truth]
- Rejects Truth: Embraces relativism and assumes all inequality
proves discrimination without examining individual hearts and the
root causes of the inequality [lacks truth]. Assumes financial/career
success are the ultimate “end” [false truth]. - Perverts Justice:
Creates reverse discrimination to achieve equal outcomes rather
than equal dignity [false justice] - Prevents Communion: Divides
people into oppressor/oppressed groups that cannot reconcile [lacks
mercy]

Why It Fails: Woke love points inward toward group iden-
tity and grievance rather than outward toward the authentic
good of all people. It makes the self (or group) the measure of truth
and justice, which is the essence of sin rather than love.

The Authentic Alternative: Perfect Love addresses the
marginalized through the sacred dignity of imago Dei,
sacrificial service to the vulnerable, covenant commitment
to inclusion, and the integration of truth, justice, and
mercy.

Sacred: Every person bears God’s image regardless of race, sex or so-
cial status - this gives universal dignity that no identity category can
provide. Sacrificial: We give up comfort, privilege, and resources
to serve those who suffer, following Christ’s example of laying down

                                 213
Chapter 11 Counterfeit Love - What Love Is Not


His life for others. Covenant: We make permanent commitments
to stand with the marginalized, not temporary activism that fades
when it’s no longer fashionable. Truth: We tell people the truth
about what leads to human flourishing, even when it’s diﬀicult; we
acknowledge that some differences in outcomes result from different
choices, circumstances, or gifts. True Justice: We work to ensure
everyone receives equal dignity and opportunity as image-bearers of
God, while recognizing that equal outcomes are neither possible nor
necessarily just. True Mercy: We show compassion to those who
have sinned (including ourselves) while helping them find healing and
growth. Life-giving Communion: We create communities where
everyone belongs because they are loved by God, united by our com-
mon humanity rather than divided by identity categories – The King-
dom of God – The Church.

This approach actually heals marginalization by addressing its root
cause (failure to recognize imago Dei) rather than creating new forms
of division through forced equity measures.


2. Gender Ideology “Love”: Aﬀirming False Iden-
tity as Compassion
The Appeal: Gender ideology promises liberation from traditional
gender roles and compassion, care, acceptance (justice) for those who
feel different from their biological sex. It speaks to the genuine human
need for identity and belonging.

The Counterfeit: Gender ideology teaches that love means aﬀirm-
ing any gender identity a person claims, regardless of biological reality
[false truth]. It treats the body as irrelevant to identity and makes
subjective feelings more important than objective truth about human
nature. It also treats the body as a machine to be controlled [false jus-
tice] rather than a temple of the Holy Spirit instead of the integrated
body, mind and soul.

What It Gets Right: - Concern for Those Who Struggle: Rec-
ognizes genuine pain and confusion experienced by those with gender
dysphoria - Rejection of Rigid Stereotypes: Opposes harmful

                                   214
                           Chapter 11 Counterfeit Love - What Love Is Not


stereotypes that limit how men and women can express their person-
alities - Emphasis on Acceptance: Recognizes the human need to
be loved and accepted for who we are - Attention to Bullying:
Opposes cruel treatment of those who are different or struggling -
Desire for Authenticity: Values being true to oneself rather than
conforming to external pressures - Critique of Superficiality: Re-
jects shallow definitions of masculinity and femininity

What It Gets Wrong: - Denies Imago Dei: Rejects God’s cre-
ation of humans as male and female, attempting to remake the image
of God according to human will [false truth] - Rejects Truth: De-
nies biological reality and the integration of body, mind and soul
[lacks truth] - Corrupts Mercy: Enables harmful medical interven-
tions rather than providing authentic healing [false mercy] - Perverts
Justice: Violates women’s rights by allowing biological males into fe-
male spaces [false justice]

Why It Fails: Gender ideology points inward toward sub-
jective feelings rather than outward toward objective truth
and the authentic good (justice) of the person. It demands
that reality conform to desire, which is the opposite of authentic love
that accepts and integrates truth.

The Authentic Alternative: Perfect Love addresses gender
confusion through the sacred dignity of embodied existence,
sacrificial acceptance of our created nature, covenant com-
mitment to authentic identity, and the integration of body,
mind, and soul.

Sacred: Our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians
6:19) and integral to our identity as image-bearers of God, created
male and female. Sacrificial: We accept the limitations and gifts
of our embodied existence rather than demanding that reality con-
form to our desires. Covenant: We embrace our identity as sons or
daughters of God, living according to His design for human flourishing.
Truth: We acknowledge the objective reality of biological sex and the
significance of sexual complementarity for human relationships and
we teach the true meaning of love and acceptance. Justice: We pro-
tect the rights of women and children while showing compassion to

                                 215
Chapter 11 Counterfeit Love - What Love Is Not


those who struggle with gender confusion. Mercy: We offer authen-
tic healing through the complete Catholic Faith - prayer, the Mass,
the Sacraments, spiritual direction, studying God’s Truth about who
we are and our sexuality and community support rather than imme-
diately turning to medical interventions. Life-giving Communion:
We celebrate the beautiful complementarity of male and female that
reflects the Trinity and enables the creation of new life.

This approach provides genuine healing by helping people integrate
their body, mind, and soul according to God’s design, rather than
fragmenting their identity through rejection of their embodied nature.


3. Politics and Secular Solutions as Salvation
The Appeal: Politics and secular solutions promise that the right
laws, policies, and government programs can solve humanity’s deepest
problems and create a just society for all.

The Counterfeit: This ideology places ultimate hope in political
systems, parties, and secular governance while insisting that faith
and moral principles must be kept separate from public life. It treats
government power as the primary means of achieving justice and hu-
man flourishing, rather than the transformation of hearts through
authentic love. It claims “authority” when it is not the “author” of
truth, justice and mercy and must dictate its laws even if they are
against the truth, justice and mercy.

What It Gets Right: - Concern for Justice: Recognizes that
laws and policies have real effects on people’s lives and that govern-
ment has a role in protecting rights - Desire for Order: Seeks to cre-
ate stable institutions that can address social problems systematically
- Protection of Pluralism: Attempts to create space for people of
different beliefs to coexist peacefully - Critique of Theocracy: Op-
poses the abuse of religious authority to oppress or coerce others -
Practical Focus: Emphasizes concrete policies and measurable out-
comes rather than abstract ideals - Universal Concern: Seeks laws
that apply equally to all citizens regardless of their personal beliefs

What It Gets Wrong: - Denies God’s Sovereignty: Treats hu-

                                   216
                           Chapter 11 Counterfeit Love - What Love Is Not


man government as autonomous from divine authority and moral law
[false truth] - Rejects Truth: Excludes objective moral principles
from public discourse [lacks truth] - Distorts the Sacred: Makes
politics ultimate rather than penultimate, creating idols of human
systems [false truth] - Points Love Inward: Seeks tribal political
victories rather than authentic common good [lacks justice]

Why It Fails: Politics points inward toward partisan victory
rather than outward toward the authentic good of all citi-
zens. It seeks power for its own sake rather than serving the common
good rooted in divine law. It misunderstands the role of government
and what true authority actually is.

Modern politicians think they can make people act morally toward
one another, but love is a gift that wells up from the heart of each
individual, not something that can be dictated and pushed down from
on high.

The Authentic Alternative: Perfect Love transforms soci-
ety through voluntary submission to the “law of Christ”,
morally-formed Christians who bring the light of truth, jus-
tice, and mercy into the public square, electing representa-
tives and supporting laws that reflect God’s design for the
“common good”.

     Authority does not derive its moral legitimacy from itself.
     It must not behave in a despotic manner, but must act
     for the common good as a ‘moral force based on freedom
     and a sense of responsibility’

     — CCC 1903

Sacred: Government authority comes from God and must serve His
purposes for human dignity and the common good. Human fulfillment
comes from communion with God, not material wealth. Sacrificial:
Christians engage in politics not for personal gain or tribal victory,
but to serve others, especially the vulnerable. Covenant: We make
binding commitments to moral principles that transcend party poli-
tics and guide our civic participation. Truth: Objective moral law
provides the foundation for just laws and policies; faith and reason

                                 217
Chapter 11 Counterfeit Love - What Love Is Not


together inform public discourse. Justice: Everyone receives fair
treatment and protection under the law. Mercy: We show compas-
sion for those who struggle economically or socially while maintain-
ing moral principles. Life-giving Communion: We build a society
where faith and public life are integrated, where…

      Moral citizens elect moral representatives who pass moral
      laws.

Government and policies that come from people who are well formed
in the truth, justice and mercy of God and who seek to serve the
genuine common good by grounding human law in divine law and
forming citizens who can participate wisely in democratic governance.

The greatest human authority comes from people voluntarily submit-
ting to a Government that is filled with people who are honoring and
following the truth, justice and mercy of God. This is the heart of
what it means to be Catholic and a Christian.

With every scandal of corruption, abuse of power, and failure to serve
the common good, the submission of the people to the Government
is weakened - why? Because all people - even atheists are aware of
injustice and immorality when they see it. They just don’t know what
the answer to the root of this problem is. The answer is the Catholic
Faith in Jesus Christ.

      The common good is always oriented towards the progress
      of persons: ‘The order of things must be subordinate to
      the order of persons, and not the other way around’

     — CCC 1912

When government makes persons subordinate to systems, ideology, or
power, it violates this fundamental principle.

      True “Authority” comes from the true “Author” of truth,
      justice and mercy.

                                   218

4. Sentimental/Romantic/Over-sexualized “Love”:
Feelings and Pleasure Without Commitment
The Appeal: This counterfeit promises the joy of emotional connec-
tion and physical pleasure without the diﬀiculty of sacrifice or per-
manent commitment. It speaks to genuine human needs for affection,
intimacy, and happiness.

The Counterfeit: This ideology reduces love to feelings, emotions,
and sexual pleasure, teaching that love means “following your heart”
and satisfying desires regardless of consequences. It avoids the truth,
justice, sacrifice, and covenant commitment that authentic love re-
quires.

What It Gets Right: - Importance of Emotions: Recognizes
that feelings and emotions are real and important aspects of human
experience - Desire for Joy: Correctly identifies that love should
bring happiness and fulfillment to human life - Beauty of Human
Love: Recognizes that romantic love and physical intimacy are gen-
uinely beautiful gifts - Rejection of Coldness: Opposes harsh, un-
feeling approaches to relationships that lack warmth and affection -
Desire for Intimacy: Correctly identifies the human need for deep,
personal connection with another person - Celebration of Beauty:
Appreciates the attractive aspects of love that draw people together

What It Gets Wrong: - Rejects the Sacred: Treats love as
purely human emotion rather than participation in God’s nature
[lacks truth] - Avoids Sacrifice: Promises love without cost, commit-
ment, or diﬀiculty [lacks justice] - Corrupts Truth: Makes feelings
the measure of reality rather than objective truth about human flour-
ishing [false truth] - Prevents Communion: Creates relationships
based on mutual use rather than mutual self-gift [lacks mercy]

Why It Fails: Sentimental love points inward toward per-
sonal satisfaction rather than outward toward the authentic
good of the beloved. It makes the other person responsible for our
happiness, which no creature can provide - only God can satisfy the
human heart.

The Authentic Alternative: Perfect Love addresses the need

                                 219
Chapter 11 Counterfeit Love - What Love Is Not


for joy, intimacy, and connection through the sacred nature
of human love, sacrificial commitment, covenant bonds, and
the integration of feeling, reason, and divine purpose.

Sacred: Human love and sexuality are participation in God’s own
creative love, pointing beyond themselves to the ultimate source of
fulfillment. Sacrificial: We seek the good of the beloved rather than
using them for our own emotional or physical satisfaction, willing to
suffer for their sake. Covenant: Marriage provides the permanent,
exclusive commitment needed to welcome and raise children in love
and security. Truth: We acknowledge that no human being can sat-
isfy our infinite longing - only God can do that; we order our emotions
and desires according to reason and revelation. Justice: We give our
beloved what they deserve as an image-bearer of God, not making
unreasonable demands for constant emotional or sexual satisfaction.
Mercy: We forgive each other’s failures and help each other grow
in holiness and authentic love. Life-giving Communion: Marriage
creates new life (children) and points to the ultimate communion be-
tween Christ and His Church; single life witnesses to the truth that
God alone can satisfy the human heart.

This produces relationships that are both passionate AND stable,
both emotionally fulfilling AND realistic, both intimate AND ordered
toward God as the ultimate good.


5. Contraception: Separating Marital Love from
Life-Giving Communion
The Appeal: Contraception promises sexual intimacy without the
“burden” of children or the need for permanent commitment. It offers
the pleasure of sexual union while avoiding what it sees as unwanted
consequences.

The Counterfeit: This ideology teaches that authentic love requires
separating the unitive and procreative aspects of sexuality. It treats
fertility as a disease to be suppressed and children as obstacles to
romantic fulfillment rather than the natural fruit of marital love.

What It Gets Right: - Desire for Intimacy: Recognizes the

                                   220
                            Chapter 11 Counterfeit Love - What Love Is Not


genuine human need for physical and emotional closeness with an-
other person - Concern for Timing: Acknowledges that couples
may have legitimate reasons to space pregnancies for health or eco-
nomic reasons - Recognition of Burden: Understands that raising
children requires significant sacrifice and resources - Emphasis on
Choice: Values the ability to make decisions about one’s life and
future - Practical Focus: Attempts to address real concerns about
poverty, health, and family size - Attention to Women: Recognizes
that women bear the physical burden of pregnancy and childbearing
- especially outside of marriage

What It Gets Wrong: - Denies God’s Design: Rejects the nat-
ural connection between authentic love, sexual union and procreation
[lacks truth] - Corrupts Love: Reduces sexual intimacy to mutual
pleasure-seeking rather than total self-gift that includes openness self-
gift to the life of the child [lacks mercy] - Perverts Justice: Treats
children as burdens rather than gifts with inherent dignity [false jus-
tice] - Distorts the Sacred: Treats the body as a machine to be
controlled rather than a temple of the Holy Spirit. Fails to recognize
the sacred dignity of the complete human person, body, mind and soul
[false truth] - Leads to Abortion: Creates the mentality that chil-
dren are unwanted “accidents” to be eliminated when contraception
fails [false mercy]. As St. John Paul II taught in Evangelium Vitae:
“It is frequently asserted that contraception, if made widely avail-
able and used, is the most effective remedy against abortion… But
the contraceptive mentality—which is very different from responsible
parenthood—presupposes a self-centered concept of freedom, which
regards procreation as an obstacle to personal fulfillment. The life
which could result from a sexual encounter thus becomes an enemy
to be avoided at all costs, and abortion becomes the only possible
decisive response to failed contraception.”

Why It Fails: Contraception points inward toward personal
pleasure and convenience rather than outward toward the
authentic good of spouse and potential children. It funda-
mentally alters sexual intimacy by removing its life-giving dimension,
making it self-serving rather than self-giving.

                                  221
Chapter 11 Counterfeit Love - What Love Is Not


The Authentic Alternative: Perfect Love embraces the sa-
cred unity of the unitive and procreative aspects of sexuality,
within the loving covenant of marriage between Mother and
Father.

Sacred: Sexual intimacy is a participation in God’s creative love and
reflects the life-giving communion of the Trinity - it is an deep and
beautiful expression of the unity and self-giving of the body, mind and
soul to each other. Sacrificial: Spouses give themselves completely
to each other, including their fertility, accepting the children God may
send as gifts rather than burdens. Covenant: Marriage provides
the permanent, exclusive commitment needed to welcome and raise
children in love and security. Truth: We acknowledge that fertility
is not a disease but a fundamental aspect of human sexuality and the
image of God. Justice: Children have an inherent right to life based
on our sacred duty as parents to protect and nurture them. Mercy:
We show compassion for couples struggling with infertility or diﬀicult
pregnancies while maintaining openness to God’s plan. Life-giving
Communion: Sexual intimacy creates the possibility of new life and
strengthens the bond between spouses through total self-gift.

This approach produces marriages that are both deeply intimate AND
open to life, both pleasurable AND purposeful, both unitive AND
procreative according to God’s design.

Note that the Church is not oblivious to reasons that a married cou-
ple may choose to delay having a child for a time. This is why it can
define, through what is truly just and merciful, options like natural
family planning, as a valid means of avoiding pregnancy for a spe-
cific time period - while always remaining open to the possibility of
children.

You can read more about the Church’s teaching on sexuality and
contraception in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, CCC 2360-
2379. Also read the encyclical Humanae Vitae by Pope Paul VI and
Theology of the Body by St. John Paul II — A deeper dive into how
sexuality, love, and self-gift fit into God’s plan.

6. Marxist “Love”: Class Struggle as Salvation
The Appeal: Marxism promises justice for the oppressed and lib-
eration from economic exploitation. It speaks to the genuine human
cry for fairness and dignity.

The Counterfeit: Marxism reduces all human relationships to
power struggles between economic classes. It teaches that love means
hating the “oppressor class” and that violence against enemies is
actually compassion for the oppressed.

What It Gets Right: - Concern for Economic Justice: Rec-
ognizes that extreme poverty and exploitation are genuine evils that
cause real suffering - Critique of Greed: Correctly identifies that
excessive attachment to wealth can corrupt individuals and societies
- Solidarity with Workers: Understands that laborers deserve dig-
nity, fair wages, and safe working conditions - Recognition of Sys-
temic Problems: Sees that some economic problems may require
structural solutions, not just individual charity - Call for Sacrifice:
Demands that people give up personal comfort for the sake of others
(though misdirected) - Universal Vision: Seeks to create a world
where all people have what they need to flourish

What It Gets Wrong: - Distorts Justice: Defines justice as class
warfare rather than giving each person their due as image-bearers of
God [false justice] - Corrupts Truth: Makes material conditions the
ultimate reality and goal, ignoring love as the ultimate good of hu-
man existence [false truth] - Prevents Communion: Creates perma-
nent enemies rather than seeking reconciliation and conversion [lacks
mercy] - Rejects the Sacred: Treats humans as purely material
beings without souls or eternal destiny [lacks truth]

Why It Fails: Marxist love points inward toward group
power and material gain rather than outward toward the
authentic good of all people, including supposed enemies.
It seeks to destroy rather than convert, which is the opposite of
Christ’s love that seeks the salvation of all.

The Authentic Alternative: Perfect Love addresses economic
injustice through the sacred dignity of work, sacrificial shar-

                                 223
Chapter 11 Counterfeit Love - What Love Is Not


ing of resources, covenant commitment to the common good,
and the integration of truth, justice, and mercy.

Sacred: Work participates in God’s creative activity, giving every la-
borer dignity regardless of their economic class. Human fulfillment
comes from communion with God, not material wealth. Sac-
rificial: The wealthy voluntarily share their resources (not through
coercion), and workers offer their labor as service to the community.
Covenant: Employers and employees make binding commitments
to each other’s good, creating stable relationships rather than ex-
ploitative ones. Truth: We acknowledge that some inequality results
from different choices, talents, and circumstances, not just oppression.
Justice: Everyone receives fair wages, safe working conditions, and
respect for their dignity. Mercy: We help those who struggle eco-
nomically without destroying those who have succeeded. Life-giving
Communion: We create economic relationships based on mutual ser-
vice rather than class warfare.

Catholic social teaching offers concrete principles: living wages,
worker dignity, legitimate private property, preferential option for
the poor, subsidiarity, and solidarity. This creates prosperity and
justice for all rather than victory of one class over another.



11.5      How to Minister to Those Caught in
          Counterfeits
As Catholics who understand authentic love, we are called to help
others see through these deceptions. Here’s how:


1. Start with Aﬀirmation of Their Good Desires
Don’t begin by attacking their ideology. Begin by aﬀirming
the good desires that drew them to it: - “I can see that you really
care about justice—that’s a beautiful thing. What does true justice
look like to you?” - “Your heart for the suffering shows real mercy.
How do we know when our mercy is truly helping people?” - “You
want truth and authenticity—that’s so important. How can we be

sure we’re pursuing the whole truth?” - “You desire acceptance and
belonging—we all do. What kind of acceptance do you think leads to
real peace?”


2. Ask Questions That Help Them Examine Their
Pursuit
Help them discover whether they’re pursuing the ultimate
good versions of these desires: - “You want justice—but does
this approach create more division or more unity among people?” -
“You seek truth—but does this ideology welcome questions and exam-
ination, or does it shut down inquiry?” - “You desire mercy for the
suffering—but does this method actually heal people or keep them
dependent?” - “You want acceptance—but does this community ac-
cept you when you disagree, or only when you conform?” - “If this
is about love, why does it seem to require hatred of certain groups
of people?” - “Are you finding the peace, joy, and fulfillment you
were looking for?” - “You want to make a difference in the world—
that’s wonderful. How do you know this approach is actually making
a positive difference?” - “Can this be applied across all people, for all
time?” If not, it is a clue that it doesn’t reflect the “image of God”
in each person.


3. Share the Beauty of Authentic Love
Show them what they’re really looking for - and how au-
thentic love actually delivers it:

For Those Seeking Justice: - “You want real justice? Look at
how St. Martin de Porres achieved racial equality through love, not
division - he actually changed hearts and created lasting unity.” -
“Catholic social teaching has concrete principles for economic justice
that protect both workers and employers - it’s more complete than
class warfare.” - “What if there was a way to fight injustice that
didn’t require hating anyone? That actually converted oppressors
into allies?”

For Those Seeking Truth: - “You want authentic truth? The

                                  225
Chapter 11 Counterfeit Love - What Love Is Not


Catholic Church welcomes the hardest questions - we have 2,000 years
of the greatest minds wrestling with truth.” - “What if you could
pursue truth without having to shut down opposing voices? Without
fear that questioning leads to rejection?” - “There’s a way to seek
authenticity that integrates your whole person - body, mind, and
soul - not just feelings or ideology.”


For Those Seeking Mercy: - “You want to help the suffering?
Look at how Mother Teresa actually healed people - she addressed
both their physical and spiritual needs.” - “What if there was a way
to show mercy that truly empowered people instead of keeping them
dependent?” - “Catholic hospitals, schools, and charities have lifted
more people out of poverty than any ideology - through love, not
politics.”


For Those Seeking Acceptance: - “You want real belonging? In
Christ, you’re accepted not because you conform to group identity,
but because you’re loved as God’s child.” - “What if there was a
community that loved you enough to help you become your best self,
not just aﬀirm whatever you feel?” - “There’s a family where you
belong forever - not just while you agree with the current ideology.”


Show Them the Beauty in Action: - Invite them to see authentic
love working in your parish, Catholic charities, or pro-life pregnancy
centers - Share stories of saints who achieved what they’re seeking
through authentic love - Explain how the comprehensive definition
of perfect love actually fulfills their deepest desires more completely
than any counterfeit




4. Be Patient with the Process

Remember that you were once lost too. Conversion from coun-
terfeit love to authentic love takes time, prayer, and grace. Your role
is to plant seeds and trust the Holy Spirit to bring the harvest.

11.6 The Call to Childlike Discernment
Christ’s command to “become like children” (Matthew 18:3) includes
recovering the moral clarity that recognizes counterfeit love immedi-
ately. We must return to the humility, trust, and wonder that
allows us to see through sophisticated deceptions and recognize au-
thentic love in its beautiful simplicity.

This doesn’t mean becoming naive or gullible. It means recovering
the clarity of heart that sees truth directly, without the distortions of
pride, fear, or self-interest.


11.7 Living the Response
Daily Practice: - Morning Prayer: Ask the Holy Spirit for the gift
of discernment to recognize authentic love - Scripture Study: Read
1 John 4:1-21 to understand how to “test the spirits” - Examination
of Conscience: Ask yourself: “What forms of counterfeit love am I
tempted by?” - Acts of Authentic Love: Practice truth, justice,
mercy, and sacrifice in small ways

Weekly Practice: - Eucharistic Adoration: Spend time with
Jesus, the source of all authentic love - Works of Mercy: Serve
others in ways that reflect complete love, not ideological agenda -
Study Catholic Social Teaching: Learn how the Church addresses
social problems authentically

Monthly Practice: - Spiritual Direction: Discuss with a priest or
spiritual director how to recognize and resist counterfeits - Apologet-
ics Study: Learn how to explain Catholic teaching on love to others
- Missionary Activity: Look for opportunities to share authentic
love with those caught in counterfeits

Heavenly Father, You are Love itself, and You have revealed to us what
authentic love truly is through Your Son Jesus Christ. Protect us from
the deceptions of our time that promise love but deliver hatred, that
promise justice but create oppression, that promise truth but spread
lies. Give us the gift of discernment to recognize counterfeit love
immediately, and the courage to speak the truth in love to those who

                                  227
Chapter 11 Counterfeit Love - What Love Is Not


have been deceived. Help us to be instruments of Your authentic love
in a world hungry for the real thing. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.


11.8      Examen:             Recognizing Counterfeit
          Love
Evening Reflection: 1. What forms of counterfeit love was
I tempted by today? (Sentimentalism, utilitarianism, ideologi-
cal thinking, romantic idolatry) 2. How did I respond to those
caught in counterfeit love? (With condemnation or with mercy?
With truth or with compromise?) 3. What authentic love did
I witness or practice today? (Truth, justice, mercy, and sacri-
fice working together) 4. How can I better recognize and resist
counterfeits tomorrow? (Prayer, study, spiritual direction, acts of
authentic love)

Daily Practice: Before engaging with media, social movements, or
ideological content, pray: “Holy Spirit, help me to test this spirit.
Does this lead to authentic love—truth, justice, mercy, and sacrifice—
or to a counterfeit that divides, deceives, or destroys?”

Act of Spiritual Discernment: Jesus, You are the Way, the Truth,
and the Life. You have shown us what authentic love looks like. Help
me to recognize immediately anything that claims to be love but lacks
your truth, justice, mercy, sacrifice, covenant, and communion. Give
me the courage to reject counterfeits and the wisdom to help others
see through deceptions. I trust in Your love, which is perfect and
complete. Amen.




11.9      Further Study
Understanding counterfeit love requires deep knowledge of
authentic love. These resources will help you develop the
discernment needed to recognize and resist deceptions while
ministering to those who have been deceived.

     is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.”

12.1     The Rich              Treasury           of     Catholic
         Virtue
In our journey through the essential facets of perfect love—truth,
justice, mercy, sacrifice, and covenant—we have laid the foundation

                                 232
                                                      Chapter 12 Virtues


for authentic Catholic living. But the Church’s treasury of wisdom
contains many more virtues, each a facet of the diamond of God’s
perfect love, each reflecting the light of divine love in its own unique
way. These virtues are not separate from our comprehensive defini-
tion of love; rather, they are the beautiful expressions of how truth,
justice, mercy, and covenant love manifest themselves in the countless
situations of daily life.

     A virtue is a habit or practice of walking in truth, justice,
     and mercy. A vice, or sin, is a habit of twisting or refusing
     these—sometimes from willful choice, other times from
     not yet knowing the good.

Think of these virtues as the many faces of love—each one revealing
a different aspect of how God loves us and how we are called to
love Him and our neighbors. Just as a diamond has many facets
that catch and reflect light differently depending on the angle, so
perfect love expresses itself through different virtues depending on
the circumstances we face.

The Catholic tradition has identified and developed these virtues over
two millennia, guided by Scripture, the wisdom of the saints, and the
teaching authority of the Church. Each virtue represents a way of
participating in God’s own life, a means of growing in holiness, and
a path to becoming the saints God calls us to be.



12.2 How All Virtues Serve Perfect Love
Before we explore these individual virtues, it’s crucial to understand
how they all work together to serve our comprehensive definition of
perfect love. Remember, perfect love is “the sacred, sacrificial gift
of covenant, binding truth, justice, and mercy, gathering us into life-
giving communion.” Every authentic virtue either:

  • Serves Truth by helping us see reality clearly and choose what
    is genuinely good
  • Serves Justice by helping us give each person what they are
    owed according to their dignity

                                  233
Chapter 12 Virtues


   • Serves Mercy by helping us respond to human frailty with
     healing and forgiveness
   • Serves Covenant by helping us build and maintain faithful
     relationships
   • Serves Communion by helping us grow in union with God
     and authentic fellowship with others

No virtue stands alone. Each one gains its meaning and power from
its relationship to perfect love. This is why the Church has always
taught that love is the “form” of all virtues—the principle that gives
them their shape, direction, and ultimate purpose.

The Catechism makes this beautifully clear in its opening paragraphs
and throughout its teaching. CCC 1 teaches that God calls us to
share in His own blessed life, CCC 25 explains that all Scripture is
given to lead us to love, and CCC 309 reveals that everything God
permits serves His plan of love and works against the problem of evil
in our hearts. Every doctrine the Church teaches, every virtue she
promotes, every sacrament she offers—all of these orient us toward
God’s Perfect Love and away from the evil that destroys our souls,
relationships, and society.

Many books have been written about the virtues, but I want to give
a brief overview of the theological and moral virtues, and then the
cardinal virtues.



12.3      The Heart’s Response: Theological
          and Moral Virtues
     “The theological virtues are the foundation of Christian
     moral activity; they animate it and give it its special char-
     acter. They inform and give life to all the moral virtues.
     They are infused by God into the souls of the faithful to
     make them capable of acting as his children and of merit-
     ing eternal life.”

      CCC 1813

                                 234
                                                    Chapter 12 Virtues


12.4 Faith: The Foundation of All Virtue
Faith is our supernatural response to God’s self-revelation, the gift
that enables us to believe what God has revealed about Himself and
about us. But faith is more than intellectual assent—it is fundamen-
tally trust, the bedrock of any authentic relationship. Faith helps us
identify what is true and then submit our confidence to that truth,
even if we have not yet fully comprehended it.

Faith is supernatural precisely because it is a gift God has given
uniquely to human beings among all His creatures. Rocks do not
trust their Creator, nor do animals place their confidence in divine
promises. Only humans, made in God’s image, have the capacity for
this personal, trusting relationship with their Creator. Faith serves
perfect love by providing the foundation for all other virtues and by
initiating our relationship with God—not apart from love, but as one
of love’s many beautiful facets.

Faith engages our whole person—mind, body, and soul. Our minds
assent to revealed truth, our bodies participate in sacramental wor-
ship, and our souls are united to God through grace. Faith conquers
the evil of unbelief that would cut us off from the source of all love
and leave us isolated in our own limited understanding.

How it serves perfect love: Faith enables us to gradually, day by day,
see reality from God’s perspective, growing in God’s truth which is
necessary for authentic justice and mercy.

     Faith is trust that increases day by day.


12.5 Hope: Confident Expectation in
     God’s Promises
Hope is the supernatural virtue that enables us to trust confidently
in God’s promises, especially the promise of eternal life. Hope serves
perfect love by giving us the courage to persevere in virtue even when
the path is diﬀicult and the rewards seem distant.

Hope is not mere optimism or wishful thinking. It is grounded in

                                 235
Chapter 12 Virtues


God’s faithfulness and the merits of Christ’s passion and resurrection.
Hope enables us to endure suffering, overcome discouragement, and
continue loving even when love is not returned.

How it serves perfect love: Hope provides the confidence necessary
to make sacrificial choices, knowing that God will reward our faith-
fulness.


12.6      Obedience:            Submission of Will in
          Love
Obedience is the sacrificial submission of our will to legitimate au-
thority, ultimately to God’s will revealed through Scripture, Church
teaching, and the circumstances of our lives. True obedience is not
servile compliance but the free gift of a heart that trusts in God’s
wisdom and goodness.

Obedience serves perfect love by creating the order necessary for au-
thentic relationships to flourish. In marriage, mutual obedience cre-
ates harmony. In families, children’s obedience to parents creates
security. In the Church, obedience to legitimate authority preserves
unity in truth.

How it serves perfect love: Obedience enables covenant fidelity by
submitting our personal preferences to the good of the relationship
and the will of God - always in truth, justice, and mercy.


12.7      Peace: Harmony Flowing from Right
          Relationships
Peace is the tranquility that comes from right order—right relation-
ship with God, with others, and within ourselves. Peace is not merely
the absence of conflict but the positive harmony that flows from truth,
justice, and mercy working together.

True peace begins in the heart that is reconciled to God. This interior
peace then radiates outward, creating peaceful families, communities,

                                 236
                                                    Chapter 12 Virtues


and societies. Peace serves perfect love by creating the conditions
where authentic relationships can flourish.

How it serves perfect love: Peace establishes the harmonious founda-
tion where authentic fellowship and mutual self-gift can flourish.


12.8 The Disciplines of a Loving Heart:
     Cardinal Virtues

12.9 Wisdom: The Light That Guides
     Love’s Choices
Wisdom is a most valuable virtue that enables us to see all things
in relation to God and to choose what is truly good, beautiful, and
holy. Wisdom is both a gift of the Holy Spirit and a virtue developed
through prayer, study, and experience.

Wisdom serves perfect love by guiding our choices so that we act
not from impulse or emotion but from deep understanding of what
will truly serve the good of those we love. Wisdom enables us to
distinguish between authentic love and its counterfeits.

How it serves perfect love: Wisdom ensures that our justice is truly
just and our mercy is truly merciful by revealing what each situ-
ation genuinely requires.


12.10      Prudence: Right Reason in Action
Prudence is practical wisdom—the virtue that enables us to discern
the right action in particular circumstances and to choose the appro-
priate means to achieve good ends. Prudence involves taking counsel,
judging correctly, and acting decisively.

Prudence serves perfect love by ensuring that our good intentions
translate into effective action. Love without prudence can become
mere sentiment; prudence without love can become cold calculation.
Together, they enable us to love wisely and effectively.

                                237
Chapter 12 Virtues


How it serves perfect love: Prudence ensures that our love is not just
sincere but also effective, choosing actions that truly serve the good
of those we love.



12.11 Temperance: Harmonious Integra-
      tion of Body, Mind, and Soul
Temperance is the virtue that brings all aspects of our humanity
into proper harmony. It is not the suppression of bodily desires but
their proper ordering toward authentic goods. Temperance enables
us to enjoy God’s gifts without being enslaved by them.

Temperance serves perfect love by ensuring that we love with our
whole person—body, mind, and soul—in proper integration. It pre-
vents any one aspect of our humanity from dominating the others and
enables us to give ourselves completely in love.

How it serves perfect love: Temperance enables authentic self-gift by
ensuring that we have mastery over ourselves and can freely choose
to love rather than being driven by disordered desires.



12.12 Fortitude: Courage in Love
Fortitude is the virtue that enables us to persevere in good even
when it is diﬀicult, dangerous, or costly. Fortitude has two aspects:
endurance (patience in suffering) and attack (courage in action). Both
are necessary for authentic love.

Fortitude serves perfect love by giving us the strength to make sacri-
ficial choices and to persevere in covenant love even when it becomes
challenging. Without fortitude, our love remains superficial and con-
ditional.

How it serves perfect love: Fortitude enables sacrifice by giving us the
courage to choose the good of the beloved over our own comfort
or convenience.

12.13       The Fruits of Love Made Mature

12.14       Chastity:   Integrated                      Sexuality
            within Love
Chastity is the proper integration of human sexuality within the con-
text of authentic love and one’s state in life. For the married, chastity
means faithful, fruitful love; for the unmarried, it means preparation
for marriage or religious life; for religious, it means celibate love for
the Kingdom.

Chastity serves perfect love by ensuring that our sexuality serves the
good of persons rather than treating them as objects for our own
selfish pleasure. Chastity protects the sacred dignity of the human
person and enables authentic intimacy.

How it serves perfect love: Chastity ensures that our love respects
the full dignity of the human person and serves the good of
covenant relationships.



12.15       Faithfulness: Steadfast Commit-
            ment to Covenants
Faithfulness is the virtue that enables us to honor our promises and
commitments, especially when it becomes diﬀicult or costly. Faithful-
ness is love’s constancy that perseveres through trials, temptations,
and the passage of time.

Faithfulness serves perfect love by providing the stability necessary
for authentic relationships to flourish. Without faithfulness, love be-
comes merely emotional and temporary; with faithfulness, love be-
comes a rock on which others can build their lives.

How it serves perfect love: Faithfulness enables covenant love by ensur-
ing that our commitments are permanent and reliable, creating
the security necessary for authentic intimacy.

                                  239
Chapter 12 Virtues


12.16 Patience: Enduring Love That Per-
      severes
Patience is the virtue that enables us to endure diﬀiculties, delays,
and even injuries without losing our peace or abandoning our love.
Patience is not passive resignation but active perseverance in doing
good.

Patience serves perfect love by enabling us to love consistently over
time, even when the beloved is diﬀicult, ungrateful, or slow to change.
Patience prevents love from becoming conditional on immediate re-
sults or perfect behavior.

How it serves perfect love: Patience enables mercy by giving us
the strength to continue loving and forgiving even when others fail to
respond as we hope.


12.17 Kindness: Gentle Goodwill Toward
      Others
Kindness is the virtue that moves us to seek the good of others in
gentle, considerate ways. Kindness is strength exercised with tender-
ness, power used in service of the vulnerable.

Kindness serves perfect love by ensuring that our justice is tempered
with mercy and our truth is spoken with compassion. Kindness makes
our love attractive and accessible to others.

How it serves perfect love: Kindness ensures that our love is not
harsh or demanding but gentle and inviting, truly desiring the
peace and harmony of the beloved.


12.18 Generosity: Abundant Giving from
      Love
Generosity is the virtue that moves us to give abundantly from
our resources—time, talent, treasure, and attention—for the good of

                                 240
                                                       Chapter 12 Virtues


others. True generosity flows from love, not from duty or the desire
for recognition.

Generosity serves perfect love by ensuring that our love is not merely
internal but expresses itself in concrete acts of service and sacrifice of
our time, talent, and treasure. Generosity makes our love visible and
effective.

How it serves perfect love: Generosity enables sacrifice by moving
us to give freely and abundantly for the good of those we love.


12.19       Gentleness:  Strength Exercised
            with Tenderness
Gentleness is the virtue that enables us to exercise our strength and
authority with tenderness and consideration for others’ weakness and
vulnerability. Gentleness is not weakness but strength under control.

Gentleness serves perfect love by ensuring that our justice is tempered
with mercy and our correction is offered with compassion. Gentleness
makes our love healing rather than wounding.

How it serves perfect love: Gentleness ensures that our love is sensitive
to the needs and limitations of others, adapting our approach to what
they can receive.


12.20       Self-Control: Mastery Over Disor-
            dered Desires
Self-control is the virtue that enables us to master our impulses,
emotions, and desires so that we can choose freely what is truly good.
Self-control is not suppression but proper ordering of our inner life.

Self-control serves perfect love by ensuring that we love from freedom
rather than compulsion, from choice rather than impulse. Without
self-control, our love becomes unreliable and potentially harmful.

How it serves perfect love: Self-control enables authentic self-gift by
ensuring that we have mastery over ourselves and can freely choose

Chapter 12 Virtues


to love.


12.21 Joy:            Deep Happiness Rooted in
      God
Joy is the deep happiness that flows from union with God and the
practice of virtue. Joy is not dependent on external circumstances but
on the interior reality of God’s Perfect Love and the hope of eternal
life.

Joy serves perfect love by making our love attractive and life-giving.
Joyful love draws others toward God; joyless virtue repels them. Joy
is both the fruit of authentic love and the condition for its continued
growth.

How it serves perfect love: Joy makes our love attractive and conta-
gious, drawing others toward the good and enabling us to persevere
in virtue even in diﬀicult times.


12.22 The Call to Continued Growth
This brief survey of the Church’s treasury of these virtues of love
should not overwhelm you but inspire you. Each of these virtues is a
gift from God, available to you through grace, and developed through
practice and prayer. You are not expected to master them all at once,
but you are called to grow in them throughout your life.

The beauty of Catholic moral theology is that it provides a com-
plete map for human flourishing. Every situation you will face, every
challenge you will encounter, every relationship you will build—all of
these can be approached through the lens of virtue, guided by the
wisdom of the Church, and empowered by sacramental grace.

Everything the Church does and encourages fosters this growth in love.
The Mass teaches us about the love of the Trinity, and how to worship
Him - ever-deepening our relationship with Him; the saints inspire us
with their heroic examples; the liturgical seasons—especially Advent
and Lent—provide structured times for spiritual growth; all seven

                                 242
                                                     Chapter 12 Virtues


sacraments, fasting, prayer, almsgiving, and the countless sacramen-
tals offer us grace and blessing. Every aspect of Catholic life serves
the same fundamental purpose: teaching us to love the Father, Son,
and Holy Spirit with our whole hearts, and to love our neighbors as
ourselves.

Remember that virtue is not a burden but a liberation. Each virtue
you develop makes you more free, more capable of authentic love,
and more effective in serving God and neighbor. The saints were not
people who followed rules perfectly; they were people who allowed
God’s grace to transform them into instruments of perfect love.


12.23      The cost of virtue
Christian discipleship is not easy. It is a journey of growth in love,
and it requires a commitment to daily practice and sacrifice.

     “Then he said to all, ‘If anyone wishes to come after me, he
     must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow
     me.’ ”

     Luke 9:23

     “Every athlete exercises discipline in every way. They do
     it to win a perishable crown, but we an imperishable one.
     Thus I do not run aimlessly; I do not fight as if I were
     shadowboxing. No, I drive my body and train it, for fear
     that, after having preached to others, I myself should be
     disqualified.”

     1 Corinthians 9:25-27

     “Let us not grow tired of doing good, for in due time we
     shall reap our harvest, if we do not give up.”

     Galatians 6:9

     “Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righ-
     teousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”

     Matthew 5:10

                                 243
Chapter 12 Virtues


     “In this you rejoice, although now for a little while you
     may have to suffer through various trials, so that the gen-
     uineness of your faith, more precious than gold that is
     perishable even though tested by fire, may prove to be for
     praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.”

      1 Peter 1:6-7

If you want to fight against evil, you must be willing to pay the price
of love.

12.25 A Prayer for Growth in Virtue
Lord Jesus, You are the source and model of all virtue. You perfectly
embodied truth, justice, mercy, and covenant love in Your life, death,

and resurrection. Help me to grow in all the virtues that reflect Your
perfect love.

Grant me faith to believe in Your promises, hope to trust in Your
providence, and love to serve You in my neighbors. Give me wisdom to
see clearly, prudence to choose rightly, temperance to live moderately,
and fortitude to persevere courageously.

Help me to live chastely according to my state in life, faithfully in
all my commitments, patiently in all my trials, and kindly in all my
relationships. Make me generous in giving, gentle in correcting, self-
controlled in all things, and joyful in Your service.

Above all, help me to live sacramentally, ordering my entire life around
the Mass and the sacraments, so that Your grace may transform every
aspect of my existence. May I become the saint You call me to be,
for Your glory and the good of all those You have given me
to love. Amen.



12.26       Examen: Growing in Virtue
Evening Reflection: 1. Which virtue did I practice well today?
How did it serve perfect love? 2. Which virtue did I neglect or fail
to practice? How did this failure harm my relationships? 3. What
specific situation challenged me to grow in virtue? How did I respond?
4. How did I experience God’s grace helping me to choose virtue over
vice?

Daily Practice: Before making any significant decision, ask yourself:
“Which virtue does this situation call for? How can I respond in a
way that serves perfect love?”

Act of Contrition: “My God, I am sorry for my failures in virtue.
Help me to grow in holiness so that I may love You and my neighbors
as You have loved me.”

The “Gospel”

  “God is love, and whoever remains in love remains in God
  and God in him.”

  1 John 4:16

  “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only
  Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but
  have eternal life.”

  John 3:16

  “The whole concern of doctrine and its teaching must be
  directed to the love that never ends. Whether something is
  proposed for belief, for hope, or for action, the love of our
  Lord must always be made accessible, so that anyone can
  see that all the works of perfect Christian virtue spring
  from love and have no other objective than to arrive at
  love.”

Chapter 13 The “Gospel”


13.1      The Greatest Story Ever Told
If you could know only one thing about the universe, about yourself,
about the meaning of existence itself, it would be this: God is per-
fect love, and He created you to share in that love forever.

This is the Good News—not just a nice religious idea, but the fun-
damental reality that explains everything: why you exist, why you
long for love, why evil hurts so deeply, why nothing in this world
fully satisfies, and why your heart was made for something infinite
and eternal. As the psalmist cries, “As the deer pants for streams of
water, so my soul pants for you, my God” (Psalm 42:1).

The story begins before time itself, in the eternal communion of the
Trinity—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—living in perfect love. This
love is not simply a feeling or emotion, but the very essence of God’s
being. It is perfect love: the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant,
binding truth, justice, and mercy, gathering us into life-giving com-
munion. The Father eternally gives Himself completely to the Son,
the Son eternally gives Himself completely to the Father, and their
mutual love is so real, so personal, that He is the Holy Spirit—the
Third Person of the Trinity. This is the perfect unity Jesus prayed
for: “that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and
I am in you” (John 17:21).¹

This divine love is not contained or selfish. Perfect love overflows,
creates, gives life. And so God, in His infinite goodness, chose to
create the universe as an act of pure love—not because He needed
anything, but because love desires to share itself. He created you,
specifically you, in His own image and likeness, with the capacity to
know Him, love Him, and share in His eternal happiness.


13.2      The Image of God: Your True Iden-
          tity
You are not an accident of evolution or a random collection of atoms.
You are made in the image of God (Genesis 1:27), which means you
carry within your very being a reflection of divine love. This is why

                                 248
                                                  Chapter 13 The “Gospel”


you hunger for truth—because God is Truth. This is why you cry out
for justice—because God is Justice. This is why you long for mercy—
because God is Mercy. This is why you need authentic relationships—
because God is perfect Communion.

Your body, mind, and soul were created to work in harmony, each
aspect reflecting God’s love in its own way. As the psalmist declares,
“I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made” (Psalm
139:14). Your body was made for sacred relationship, not mere plea-
sure. Your mind was made to know truth, not just accumulate infor-
mation. Your soul was made for eternal communion with God, not
temporary satisfaction with created things.

This is your true dignity: you are a beloved child of God, created for
eternal happiness, called to participate in divine love itself. No earthly
success or failure, no human praise or criticism, no circumstance of
life can change this fundamental truth about who you are.


13.3 The Problem: Sin and the Slavery of
     Lesser Loves
But something went wrong. The first humans, Adam and Eve, faced
a choice: trust God’s word that eating from the tree of the knowl-
edge of good and evil would bring death, or believe the serpent’s lie
that they would “be like God, knowing good and evil” (Genesis 3:5).
They chose to grasp at divine knowledge and power for themselves
rather than receive wisdom as a gift from God. They chose imme-
diate gratification over patient trust, autonomous self-determination
over loving dependence, the promise of becoming “like God” over the
reality of being beloved children of God. In choosing the fruit, they
chose themselves as the ultimate authority over good and evil rather
than submitting to God as the source of all truth and goodness. This
original sin damaged human nature, not by destroying the image of
God within us, but by disordering our loves.²

Now, instead of looking at all of God’s creation and the moral law
written in our hearts with gratitude, we experience what St. Paul
describes: “I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not

                                   249
Chapter 13 The “Gospel”


want to do—this I keep on doing” (Romans 7:19). We tend to make
created things into gods. We worship career over family, pleasure
over purity, convenience over life, self over service. We seek our ul-
timate happiness in things that cannot provide it—what Scripture
calls “the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life”
(1 John 2:16)—money, power, sexual pleasure, human approval, en-
tertainment, comfort.

This is the slavery of sin: being controlled by disordered loves, seeking
our ultimate good in things that are only secondary goods. And
because we were created for relationship with God Himself, nothing
less than God can truly satisfy the deepest longings of our hearts. We
become addicted to more—more pleasure, more success, more control,
more stuff—but we’re never fulfilled because we’re seeking in creation
what can only be found in the Creator.

This is precisely what the Ten Commandments address, beginning
with the first and most fundamental: “You shall have no other gods
before me” (Exodus 20:3). Every violation of God’s commandments
flows from making something other than God into our ultimate good—
whether it’s money, power, pleasure, or even our own will. This is
why both the Old and New Covenants teach the same essential truth:
“Love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul,
and with all your mind” (Matthew 22:37; Luke 10:25-27; Deuteron-
omy 6:5 and many others!). This complete love of God with our
whole being—heart, mind, and soul—is the antidote to the slavery of
disordered loves.

Worse, when we make lesser things into ultimate things, we inevitably
hurt others. The man who makes career his “god” neglects his family.
The woman who makes pleasure her “god” uses others for gratification.
The society that makes comfort its “god” kills inconvenient children
and elderly. The culture that makes individual autonomy its “god”
destroys the bonds of marriage, family, and community.

This is why evil exists in the world: not because God created it,
but because rational creatures with free will choose lesser goods over
the Supreme Good, and these disordered choices create suffering for
themselves and others.

                                   250
                                              Chapter 13 The “Gospel”


But here’s the crucial insight: if the problem is disordered loves—
hearts that seek ultimate satisfaction in things that cannot provide
it—then the solution must be the reordering of our loves toward their
proper end. Since we were created for relationship with God Himself,
only God can satisfy the deepest longings of our hearts. Only Perfect
Love can heal hearts enslaved to imperfect loves. Only the Supreme
Good can free us from the tyranny of lesser goods that promise ev-
erything but deliver emptiness.

This is precisely why human solutions to evil always fall short. Po-
litical systems cannot change hearts. Education cannot reorder loves.
Therapy cannot heal the fundamental disorder of seeking our ultimate
good in created things rather than the Creator. Even religion, if it
becomes merely human effort to reach God, becomes another lesser
good that enslaves rather than liberates.

The solution had to come from God Himself, for as Isaiah reminds us,
“my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,”
declares the Lord (Isaiah 55:8). Only divine wisdom could devise a
plan to heal hearts enslaved to lesser loves—not as external force or
mere teaching, but as the personal presence of Perfect Love entering
our disordered world to heal us from within. And this is exactly
what He did: Jesus became incarnate, lived among us, fulfilled the
Old Covenant on the Cross as the new Passover Lamb, rose from
the dead, established His priesthood, gave us the Sacrament of Holy
Communion in the Mass, founded His Church to guide us, gave us the
sacraments to heal and strengthen us, left us His Word in Scripture,
and provided the saints to show us what transformed love looks like
in real life.


13.4 The Solution: God’s Perfect Love In-
     carnate
The eternal Son of God became man—Jesus Christ, who “being in
very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be
used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking
the very nature of a servant” (Philippians 2:6-7)—true God and true

                                251
Chapter 13 The “Gospel”


man—to rescue us and restore us to the relationship we were created
for.³

Jesus came proclaiming the Kingdom of God (a Kingdom where God’s
Love reigns) —not as a distant future reality, but as a present earthly
Kingdom where God reigns and His people participate actively in His
divine life.� Through His incarnation, Jesus shows us that God cares
deeply about our earthly life and calls us to live the Kingdom life here
and now, transforming this world through divine love.

Jesus Christ is perfect love incarnate. In His life, He showed us what
authentic love looks like: truth spoken with compassion, justice tem-
pered with mercy, sacrifice offered freely, covenant faithfulness main-
tained even unto death. He lived the perfect integration of body,
mind, and soul—fully human yet without sin.

But Jesus didn’t come just to be a good example. He came to do
what we could not do for ourselves: to pay the price of our sins and
open the way back to the Father.


13.5      The Last Supper: Love’s Greatest
          Gift
At the Last Supper, Jesus gave us the Eucharist—His own Body and
Blood under the appearance of bread and wine. This wasn’t just a
symbolic gesture but the beginning of His sacrifice, the moment when
He gave us everything He had and everything He was. Significantly,
Jesus chose to institute the Eucharist within the Passover meal, re-
vealing Himself as the true Lamb of God who takes away the sin of
the world (John 1:29). Just as the Passover lamb’s blood protected
the Israelites from death and freed them from slavery in Egypt, Jesus’
blood frees us from the slavery of sin and protects us from spiritual
death. In the Eucharist, Jesus makes Himself our food, our life, our
strength for the journey home to the Father.�

The Eucharist reveals the depth of God’s love: He doesn’t just tell us
He loves us, He gives us Himself.

     “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go

                                  252
                                                 Chapter 13 The “Gospel”


      hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. I
      am the bread of life. Your ancestors ate the manna in the
      desert, but they died; this is the bread that comes down
      from heaven so that one may eat it and not die. I am the
      living bread that came down from heaven; whoever eats
      this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give
      is my flesh for the life of the world.”

      John 6:35, 48-51

He doesn’t just forgive our sins from a distance, He comes to dwell
within us. He doesn’t just promise us eternal life, He begins to live
that life in us right now through His sacramental presence. Through
this ultimate, perfect, sacred sacrifice—offered once for all time—
Jesus shows us that no matter what we have done to offend God,
His full and perfect mercy is available to every repentant heart.


The Cross: Justice and Mercy United
On the Cross, Jesus revealed the full depth of authentic love by unit-
ing perfect justice and perfect mercy in one redemptive act.� He took
upon Himself all the consequences of human sin—not just the legal
guilt we deserved, but the real wounds that sin creates in our body,
mind, and soul. His cry “My God, my God, why have you forsaken
me?” (Matthew 27:46) was not a moment of separation from the
Father, but Jesus quoting the opening line of Psalm 22—a messianic
psalm that begins in anguish but ends in triumph and vindication.
By invoking this psalm, Jesus was declaring that He was fulfilling
the prophetic suffering described by David, while pointing to the ul-
timate victory that the psalm promises: “All the ends of the earth
shall remember and turn to the Lord” (Psalm 22:27). He was taking
upon Himself the full weight of human alienation from God that sin
creates, while remaining in perfect union with the Father’s will and
pointing to the resurrection victory to come.

The Cross shows us that authentic love takes sin seriously—it’s not
cheap grace that ignores justice, but costly grace that fulfills Isaiah’s
prophecy: “But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed
for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him,

                                  253
Chapter 13 The “Gospel”


and by his wounds we are healed” (Isaiah 53:5). This is love that
heals us completely, not just declares us forgiven from a distance.

We killed God and yet His mercy is always more powerful than our
sin.


The Resurrection: Death Defeated, Life Restored
The Resurrection completes and validates this revelation of perfect
love.� It shows us that God’s love is not just forgiving but creative—
it doesn’t just pardon us but transforms us. The Resurrection is “the
crowning truth of our faith in Christ” because it reveals that divine
love has the power to create new life, to transform human nature
itself, and to guarantee our participation in divine life.�

But the Resurrection points us toward something even more magnifi-
cent: eternal communion with Perfect Love Himself. Christ’s glorified
body after the Resurrection shows us what authentic love produces—
not the destruction of our humanity, but its perfection and transfor-
mation. This is the love that will raise our own bodies on the last
day and unite us forever with Perfect Love Himself.

The Resurrection reveals that when we follow Christ’s love on earth—
when we choose truth over lies, justice over exploitation, mercy over
revenge, sacrifice over selfishness, covenant over convenience, and
communion over isolation—we are already experiencing a foretaste of
Holy Communion with Him in the deepest sense. Every act of authen-
tic love draws us into deeper communion with the Trinity. Christ’s
Resurrection is the guarantee that death has been conquered, and
every time we receive the Eucharist with faith, we taste this eternal
communion. Every time we love as Christ loves, we participate in
the divine life that the Resurrection makes available to us, becoming
“partakers of the divine nature” (2 Peter 1:4).

This is not only restorative love—bringing us back to where we were—
but creative love, making us something entirely new. The Resurrec-
tion is the guarantee that our deepest longing—for love that never
ends, never disappoints, never fails—will be fulfilled in eternal com-
munion with Him who is Love itself.

                                 254
                                               Chapter 13 The “Gospel”


13.6 The New Covenant: God’s Law of
     Love
Through His life, death, and resurrection, Jesus established a
New Covenant—not written on stone tablets but on human hearts
(Jeremiah 31:33; Hebrews 8:10).� This is God’s law of love, which
teaches us to live the same perfect love we defined earlier: the
sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant, binding truth, justice,
and mercy, gathering us into life-giving communion.

This New Covenant is not a set of rules to demand obedience but to
draw us into humble, obedient, sacrificial love. Consider His revolu-
tionary teachings that redefine love itself:

     “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your
     neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, love
     your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that
     you may be children of your heavenly Father, for he makes
     his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain
     on the righteous and on the unrighteous.”

     Matthew 5:43-45

     “A new commandment I give to you, that you love one
     another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one
     another. By this all people will know that you are my
     disciples, if you have love for one another.”

     John 13:34-35

     “Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down
     his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what
     I command you.”

     John 15:13-14

But the New Covenant was not just proclaimed in words—it was
instituted in the most sacred moment of human history. At the Last
Supper, Jesus spoke the words that established this eternal covenant
between God and humanity:

                                255
Chapter 13 The “Gospel”


     “Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body,
     which will be given up for you… Take this, all of you, and
     drink from it, for this is the chalice of my blood, the blood
     of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out
     for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this
     in memory of me.”

      Matthew 26:26-28; Luke 22:19-20

These words of institution reveal the heart of the New Covenant: it
is sealed not with the blood of animals, as the Old Covenant was,
but with the precious blood of God’s own Son. This covenant is
“new” because it accomplishes what the Old Covenant could only
point toward—the complete forgiveness of sins and the restoration of
humanity to friendship with God. It is “eternal” because it will never
be superseded or replaced, and its effects last forever.

These are not mere suggestions but the fundamental law of the New
Covenant—love that extends even to enemies, love that mirrors
Christ’s own sacrificial love, love that is willing to lay down life itself
for others. This is the law written on our hearts, the standard by
which citizens of God’s Kingdom live, sealed by Christ’s own Body
and Blood given for our truest healing - our salvation.


13.7      The Sacraments: Grace for the Jour-
          ney
God knows that we cannot live this law of love by willpower alone.
We need His perfect love—His own divine life shared with us—to
transform our disordered hearts and enable us to love authentically.
This is why Jesus gave us the sacraments: concrete encounters with
His grace that heal, strengthen, and sanctify us.¹�

Baptism makes us God’s adopted children and citizens of His King-
dom, washing away original sin and giving us new life in Christ.
Through Baptism, we are brought into the Kingdom of God and be-
come part of His royal priesthood. Confirmation strengthens us
with the Holy Spirit for our mission to witness to God’s love and ad-

                                   256

vance His Kingdom on earth. The Eucharist feeds us with Christ’s
own Body and Blood, making us one with Him and with each other
as we gather as the people of God’s Kingdom. Reconciliation re-
stores us to friendship with God and our place in His Kingdom when
we fall into sin. Anointing of the Sick unites our suffering with
Christ’s redemptive passion, showing that even in illness we remain
beloved citizens of His Kingdom. Matrimony creates a covenant of
love that images God’s love for His people and builds up the Kingdom
through faithful families. Holy Orders provides shepherds to guide
the people of God’s Kingdom and ministers to serve us with Christ’s
own authority.

And the Mass is where it all comes together. We gather as a covenant
community, to confess our sins, to hear the wisdom of Scripture and
our Priest teach us the Faith of Christ, to receive the Body and Blood
of Christ all as a community of love. We are then sent out from the
Mass to love God and our neighbor as God has taught us.

Through the Mass and the sacraments, God doesn’t just tell us about
His love—He gives us His love. He doesn’t just forgive us from a
distance—He comes to dwell within us. He doesn’t just promise us
eternal life—He begins to live that life in us right now, making us
active participants in His Kingdom.


13.8 The Promise: Perfect Love Forever
     in the Eternal Kingdom
The Good News culminates in a promise that staggers the human
heart: if you accept God’s love and live in response to it, you will
spend eternity in perfect communion with Perfect Love Himself in
the fullness of His Kingdom.¹¹

Heaven is not just a place but a relationship—eternal participation
in the divine love that is the Trinity. As St. Paul teaches, “Now
I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known”
(1 Corinthians 13:12). While we cannot fully comprehend what this
eternal communion will be like, Scripture promises that “no eye has
seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived, what God has

                                 257
Chapter 13 The “Gospel”


prepared for those who love him” (1 Corinthians 2:9). What we do
know is that we will find in God the fulfillment of every authentic
longing our heart has ever had. The Kingdom that begins here on
earth will reach its perfect fulfillment when Christ comes again and
makes all things new (Revelation 21:5).

This eternal life begins now, not as a future reward we earn, but as
a present reality we receive through grace. When you choose truth
over lies, justice over exploitation, mercy over revenge, sacrifice over
selfishness, covenant over convenience, and communion over isolation,
you are living the very definition of perfect love we established at the
beginning of this book. When you receive the sacraments with faith,
you are receiving Christ Himself. When you love authentically, you
are participating in the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4).


13.9      The Response: Gratitude, Humility,
          and Love
How do you respond to such Good News? With gratitude that over-
whelms the heart, humility that recognizes your complete dependence
on grace, and love that can’t help but overflow to others.

You don’t try to earn God’s love—you can’t. You don’t try to deserve
His mercy—you don’t. You don’t try to pay Him back—you couldn’t
if you tried. Instead, you simply receive His love with gratitude and
let it transform you from the inside out.

You submit to His truth, not as a burden but as liberation from the
lies that enslave. You embrace His justice, not as condemnation but
as the foundation for authentic relationships. You accept His mercy,
not as weakness but as the power that heals and restores. You offer
sacrifice, not as payment but as the natural response of a heart that
has been loved beyond measure.

You enter into covenant with Him, not as a contract but as a relation-
ship of trust. You seek communion with Him, not as an obligation
but as the deepest desire of your heart.

And in doing so, you become what you were always meant to be:

                                  258
                                                  Chapter 13 The “Gospel”


a beloved child of God, living in freedom, growing in holiness, and
sharing in the eternal love that is the source and destiny of all creation.


13.10       The Call: Join Jesus in His Mission
            for the Kingdom
Here is where the Good News becomes personal and urgent. When
a scholar of the law asked Jesus, “Teacher, what must I do to inherit
eternal life?” Jesus pointed him to the heart of everything: “You shall
love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your being,
with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor
as yourself.” And then Jesus gave him—and us—the most beautiful
invitation: “You have answered correctly; do this and you will live”
(Luke 10:25-28).

This is Jesus’ own invitation to enter into eternal life-giving commu-
nion, starting right here, right now on this earth. By loving God with
perfect justice and loving our neighbor with the perfect love we learn
from loving God, we discover what is required of the Christian—and
the reward is communion with Love Himself.

God’s love is not just for you to receive passively, but for you to
participate in actively. Once you are Baptized as a citizen of His
Kingdom, you are called to join Jesus in His mission for the salvation
of the world and the transformation of this present age. As St. Paul
teaches, this is the “law of Christ” (Galatians 6:2)—not a burden of
rules but the liberating power of love that fulfills all righteousness
and enables us to “bear one another’s burdens.”

The Kingdom of God is both a present reality and a future hope.
Jesus reigns now, and we are called to live as His people, showing
the world what life looks like when God is truly King. This means
working for justice, practicing mercy, speaking truth, making sacri-
fices for others, keeping our commitments, and building authentic
community—fulfilling Christ’s commission for the Church with His
authority to “go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them
in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and
teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you” (Matthew

                                   259
Chapter 13 The “Gospel”


28:19-20)—not as a way to earn salvation, but as the natural fruit of
hearts that have been transformed by divine love.

This is the most liberating truth of all: when you stop trying to save
yourself and instead focus on loving God and serving His Kingdom
mission, you discover that your eternal destiny is secure in His hands.
You no longer worry about whether you’re good enough for heaven
because you know that Jesus is good enough, and you are united to
Him. You no longer fear death because you know that perfect love
casts out fear (1 John 4:18).

Instead, you wake up each day asking: “How can I love God today?
How can I serve His mission? How can I be His hands and feet and
voice in a world that desperately needs to know His love?”

You become a living witness to the Good News—not perfect, but
being perfected; not sinless, but forgiven; not self-suﬀicient, but de-
pendent on grace; not earning God’s love, but responding to the love
He has already given you.

If this call is what some mean when they say we are saved by “faith
alone,” then Amen. But as we have seen, when we truly trust God, we
don’t trust in a belief about Him—we trust Him completely. We trust
Him with our whole heart, our whole being, our whole strength, and
our whole mind. We trust Him to guide us, to teach us, to transform
us, and to lead us to eternal life.

This is the complete Gospel our hearts were made for. And so when
we understand this, we have no other choice but to devote our entire
life—body, mind, and soul—to being His disciples, servants of His
love, and saints in the making.

mercy - Live each day in service to others, especially the poor, the
suffering, and those who don’t yet know God’s love - Let everything
you do be done in the name of Jesus, as St. Paul teaches: “And
whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name

Christians for fellowship, encouragement, and mutual support

Lifelong Practice: - Receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation reg-
ularly to maintain friendship with God - Study the teachings of the
Church to grow in understanding of God’s truth - Pursue your voca-
tion (marriage, religious life, or single life) as your path to holiness -

13.12       A Prayer of Response
Lord Jesus, You are the Good News incarnate. You are perfect love
made visible, divine mercy made tangible, eternal life made accessible.
Thank You for creating me in Your image, for rescuing me from sin,
for calling me to share in Your divine life.

I believe that You are God, that You died for my sins, and that You
rose from the dead. I trust in Your mercy, not in my own goodness.
I submit to Your truth, not to my own understanding. I choose Your
love over all the lesser loves that would enslave my heart.

Help me to live each day in response to Your love—not trying to earn
what You have already given, but letting Your grace transform me
from the inside out. Make me an instrument of Your peace, a witness
to Your truth, a servant of Your justice, a channel of Your mercy.

Use my life, however imperfect, to draw others to You. Help me to

                                  261
Chapter 13 The “Gospel”


love my family, serve my community, and fulfill my vocation in a way
that gives You glory and brings others closer to Your heart.

I offer You my body, mind, and soul—not as payment for Your love,
but as the natural response of a heart that has been loved beyond
measure. Do with me whatever brings You the most glory and serves
Your mission for the salvation of the world.

Mary, Mother of God, pray for me. All you saints, intercede for me.
Holy Spirit, guide me. Jesus, I trust in You. Amen.


13.13 Examen: Living in Response to
      Perfect Love
Evening Reflection: 1. How did I experience God’s love today?
In what ways did He show me His mercy, provide for my needs, or
speak to my heart? 2. How did I respond to His love? Did I live in
gratitude, humility, and service, or did I take His gifts for granted?
3. Where did I choose lesser loves over the Supreme Good? How did
these choices affect my peace and my relationships? 4. How can I
better join Jesus in His mission tomorrow? What specific acts of love,
service, or witness is He calling me to?

Daily Practice: Before making any significant decision, ask yourself:
“How does this choice serve God’s mission of love? Will this draw me
and others closer to Him or further away?”

Act of Faith, Hope, and Love: “My God, I believe in You because
You are Truth itself. I hope in You because You are Mercy itself. I
love You because You are Love itself, and You first loved me.”




13.14 A Final Word
This book is the culmination of 35 years of living life as someone
committed to understanding what the Bible says when it mentions
“God is Love”. I pray that in reading this book, you have heard the

                                 262
                                               Chapter 13 The “Gospel”


Word of God made flesh, and that you have been transformed by the
love of God, and that your heart now burns with desire to become
one with Jesus in His Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity—united to
Him in every way possible, as He is united to the Father.

If you are not yet Catholic, I invite you to Mass - today. And experi-
ence Christ in the Holy Mass that he created for us. Speak to the local
priest and ask him to help you understand the Faith of Christ. If you
are not yet Catholic, please know that the Eucharist—the Body and
Blood of Christ—is the source and summit of our faith, reserved for
those who are in full communion with the Catholic Church. This is
not exclusion, but rather the Church’s loving protection of the sacred
mystery and her desire that all who receive Christ be properly pre-
pared and united in the same faith. The Eucharist is the sacrament
of unity, and receiving it signifies complete agreement with Catholic
teaching and full membership in the Church.

But do not let this discourage you! Come to Mass, witness the beauty
of the liturgy, hear the Word of God proclaimed, and let the Holy
Spirit work in your heart. Many who are not yet Catholic find that
attending Mass regularly becomes a powerful part of their journey
toward the Church. Speak with the priest about beginning the Or-
der of Christian Initiation for Adults (OCIA), where you can learn
about the faith in a welcoming community and prepare to receive
the sacraments of initiation—Baptism (if needed), Confirmation, and
First Holy Communion.

The Church eagerly awaits your full participation in the Eucharistic
feast, where you will be able to receive Christ Himself and be united
with Him in the most intimate way possible on this side of heaven.

If you are Catholic, this book is a call to deeper conversion and more
authentic discipleship. The Church has given you the fullness of truth
and the complete means of salvation—now live it with renewed pas-
sion and commitment. Let this understanding of perfect love trans-
form how you approach the Mass, the sacraments, your prayer life,
and your daily choices.

Do not be content with mediocrity in your faith. Christ calls you to

                                 263
Chapter 13 The “Gospel”


be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect (Matthew 5:48). This is
not an impossible demand but an invitation to participate ever more
fully in the divine life that is already yours through Baptism and
Confirmation.

Examine your conscience honestly: Are you living as a true disciple
of Christ, or have you settled for cultural Christianity? Do you re-
ceive the Eucharist with proper preparation and reverence, or has it
become routine? Are you growing in holiness, or have you plateaued
in spiritual complacency?

The world desperately needs Catholics who truly understand and live
perfect love—not as a theory, but as a transforming reality. Your
family, your workplace, your community, and your parish all need
you to be the saint God is calling you to become. Do not rob them
of the witness they need by living a lukewarm faith.

Recommit yourself to the practices that will deepen your union with
Christ: frequent reception of the sacraments, especially the Eucharist
and Reconciliation; daily prayer and Scripture reading; works of
mercy and justice; and generous service to the Church’s mission. Let
this book be not just information but transformation—a catalyst
for the radical discipleship that the Gospel demands and the world
desperately needs.

May you go forth as His beloved servant of love, carrying His perfect
and true love to a world dying for truth, justice, mercy, and sacrifice
until all hearts are set aflame with the fire of divine charity and every
soul finds its ultimate Communion in Perfect Love Himself.

Amen and may God Bless us all on our journey to loving Him per-
fectly.

Appendix: The
Marriage Covenant -
Defending God’s Plan
for Human Love

     “Have you not read that he who created them from the
     beginning made them male and female, and said, ‘There-
     fore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold
     fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’? So
     they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God
     has joined together, let not man separate.”

     — Matthew 19:3-6




A.1 Introduction
While Chapter 7 explores covenant love as the universal framework for
all authentic relationships, this appendix addresses the specific chal-

                                                            Human Love


lenges facing the marriage covenant in our time. Marriage, as the fun-
damental human covenant, requires special attention because attacks
on marriage are ultimately attacks on the very nature of covenant
love itself.

The Church’s teaching on marriage is not arbitrary but flows from the
nature of covenant love revealed in Scripture and lived through the
sacraments. Understanding these teachings helps Catholics both live
their own marriages faithfully and explain to others why the Church
cannot compromise on the truth about marriage.


A.2 The Covenant Structure of Marriage
    Vows
The traditional marriage vows that couples speak at the altar are not
merely beautiful words—they follow the precise structure of biblical
covenant-making, connecting human love to the very pattern by which
God loves His people.

“I take you…”

This phrase mirrors the fundamental biblical covenant formula: “I
will be your God, and you will be my people” (Jeremiah 31:33). It
expresses mutual belonging and exclusive relationship. Just as God
“takes” His people as His own possession, spouses “take” each other
in total self-gift.

“Until death do us part…”

This echoes the eternal nature of God’s covenants. Just as God de-
clares His covenant with Abraham “everlasting” (Genesis 17:7), mar-
riage vows express permanence and irrevocability. The covenant bond
itself becomes permanent, even when lived communion may be inter-
rupted by conflict or estrangement—just as a marriage remains valid
even when spouses are separated, providing the foundation for recon-
ciliation.

“For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and
in health…”

                                  267
Appendix A Appendix: The Marriage Covenant - Defending God’s Plan for
Human Love


This unconditional commitment parallels God’s hesed (steadfast love)
that remains constant regardless of circumstances. It echoes God’s
covenant love that persists even when Israel is unfaithful, showing that
true covenant love is not conditional on performance but grounded in
the permanent bond itself.

“Before God and His Church…”

Marriage vows are spoken in the presence of witnesses, mirroring how
biblical covenants were made publicly with God invoked as guaran-
tor. The community becomes witness to the covenant bond, called to
support and protect it.

“In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Spirit…”

This Trinitarian invocation places the marriage covenant within the
very life of the Trinity itself, making human covenant-making a par-
ticipation in the divine nature. The couple doesn’t merely make
promises to each other—they enter into God’s own covenant life.

The Wedding Ring as Covenant Sign

The wedding ring serves as a covenant sign, much like circumcision
for Abraham’s covenant or the rainbow for Noah’s covenant. It’s
a visible, permanent reminder of the invisible spiritual reality—the
covenant bond that endures even when feelings change or diﬀiculties
arise.



A.3 Contemporary Challenges                                 to     the
    Marriage Covenant
Why Same-Sex Unions Cannot Be Marriage
Many good people today struggle to understand why the Catholic
Church cannot recognize same-sex unions as marriage. This is not be-
cause the Church lacks compassion for those with same-sex attraction,
but because marriage has a specific nature that cannot be changed by
human law or desire. As St. John Paul II taught in his Theology of

                                  268
    Appendix A Appendix: The Marriage Covenant - Defending God’s Plan for
                                                            Human Love


the Body, “The body, and it alone, is capable of making visible what
is invisible: the spiritual and the divine.”

The Church’s understanding of marriage is based on several unchange-
able realities:

   • Marriage images God’s relationship with humanity:
     Just as God (masculine) pours life into creation (feminine),
     marriage requires the complementarity of male and female to
     image this divine relationship
   • Covenant love is ordered toward new life: Same-sex
     unions, while they may involve genuine affection, cannot
     fulfill marriage’s essential ordering toward procreation and the
     raising of children
   • Natural law reveals marriage’s structure: The comple-
     mentarity of male and female is written into human nature itself,
     not merely cultural convention that can be changed
   • Sacramental requirements: A sacrament must use the
     proper matter and form established by Christ—the union of
     one man and one woman

As the Catechism teaches: “The matrimonial covenant, by which a
man and a woman establish between themselves a partnership of the
whole of life, is by its nature ordered toward the good of the spouses
and the procreation and education of offspring” (CCC 1601).

This teaching comes from love—both love for the truth about hu-
man nature and love for all people, including those with same-sex
attraction, who deserve to understand God’s beautiful plan for hu-
man sexuality and relationships.


Cohabitation - Counterfeit Covenant
“Living together” without marriage fails to create authentic covenant
love because it lacks: - Permanent commitment: The relationship
remains conditional and temporary - Public witness: No community
accountability or support - Sacred bond: No sacramental grace
to strengthen the relationship - Ordered toward children: Often
deliberately closed to new life - True security: Children suffer from

                                  269
Appendix A Appendix: The Marriage Covenant - Defending God’s Plan for
Human Love


the instability of uncommitted relationships

Pope John Paul II warned in Familiaris Consortio: “Marriage is not
merely a human institution despite the many variations it may have
undergone through the centuries in different cultures, social structures
and spiritual attitudes.”


Contraception’s Attack on Covenant Love
Contraception fundamentally undermines covenant love by:

   • Rejecting fruitfulness: It deliberately closes the covenant to
     its natural end—new life
   • Separating love from life: It breaks the connection between
     the unitive and procreative meanings of marriage
   • Creating utilitarian mindset: It treats fertility as a disease
     to be prevented rather than a gift to be received
   • Undermining permanence: It makes marriage about adult
     satisfaction rather than covenant commitment
   • Harming children: Pope Paul VI prophetically warned in Hu-
     manae Vitae that contraception would lead to increased divorce,
     infidelity, and the objectification of women


Civil Divorce vs. Sacramental Bond
Understanding the distinction between covenant bond and lived com-
munion helps explain the Church’s teaching on divorce:

   • Civil divorce may sometimes be necessary for legal protection,
     especially of children
   • The sacramental bond remains intact regardless of civil pro-
     ceedings
   • Estranged but not divorced: Spouses may live separately
     while remaining married, just as we can be estranged from God
     through sin while remaining His covenant children
   • Hope for restoration: The permanent bond provides the
     foundation for reconciliation and healing
   • Remarriage impossibility: Since the first marriage bond per-
     sists, attempted remarriage constitutes adultery

                                  270
    Appendix A Appendix: The Marriage Covenant - Defending God’s Plan for
                                                            Human Love


A.4 The Scandal of Broken Covenant
When marriage is treated as a disposable contract rather than a sa-
cred covenant, children suffer most. They lose: - The security of
permanent love - The model of covenant fidelity they need for their
own relationships - The witness of justice and mercy working together
in their parents’ love - The foundation of trust necessary for healthy
development - The understanding that love requires sacrifice and com-
mitment

The Devastating Statistics: - Children of divorce are twice as
likely to divorce themselves - Children from broken homes show higher
rates of depression, anxiety, and behavioral problems - The break-
down of marriage correlates directly with increases in poverty, crime,
and social dysfunction

What Children Need from Covenant Love:

Truth: Children need parents who are honest about their struggles
while remaining committed to their covenant. They need to see that
love doesn’t mean perfection but rather the commitment to work
through problems together.

Justice: Children need parents who treat each other fairly and model
the justice that creates stable relationships. They need to see that
covenant love includes accountability and mutual respect.

Mercy: Children need to witness forgiveness in action, seeing how
covenant partners can hurt each other and still choose reconciliation
over abandonment. This teaches them that love is stronger than
failure.

Sacrifice: Children need to see their parents making daily sacrifices
for each other and for the family. This teaches them that authentic
love costs something and that the cost is worth paying.

When parents fail to live covenant love, they create a devastating cycle
that perpetuates evil across generations. Children who experience
broken covenant love learn distorted lessons about relationships:

The Wounds of Broken Covenant: - Abandonment teaches

                                  271
Appendix A Appendix: The Marriage Covenant - Defending God’s Plan for
Human Love


that love is unreliable and conditional - Infidelity teaches that
promises can be broken when convenient - Divorce teaches that
commitment is temporary and optional - Cohabitation teaches
that love doesn’t require permanent commitment - Contraception
teaches that fertility is a burden rather than a blessing

These wounds create adults who struggle to make and keep covenant
commitments, perpetuating the cycle of broken love.


A.5 For the Love of Children: The Ulti-
    mate Purpose
Marriage exists primarily for the love and protection of children.
While the love between spouses is beautiful and important, the
ultimate purpose of marriage is to create stable families where
children can be conceived, born, and raised in love.

Why Children Need Both Mother and Father:

Complementary Gifts: Mothers and fathers bring different but
equally essential gifts to parenting. Mothers typically excel at nurtur-
ing, emotional attunement, and creating security. Fathers typically
excel at challenging, protecting, and preparing children for the wider
world. Children need both.

Identity Formation: Boys need fathers to show them how to be
men, and girls need fathers to show them how good men treat women.
Girls need mothers to show them how to be women, and boys need
mothers to show them how good women deserve to be treated.

Security and Stability: Children thrive when they know their fam-
ily structure is permanent. The covenant bond between parents cre-
ates the security children need to develop healthy attachment and
trust.

Justice and Mercy: Children need parents who model both firm
boundaries and forgiving love. They need to see justice and mercy
working together in their parents’ relationship, teaching them how to
balance truth and compassion in their own lives.

Covenant Fidelity: Children need the witness of parents who keep
their promises to each other. This teaches them that love is reliable,
that commitments matter, and that authentic relationships require
sacrifice and perseverance.




A.6 Breaking the Generational Cycle of
    Broken Love

For families wounded by divorce, abandonment, or broken covenant
love, healing is possible through God’s grace. Parents who have ex-
perienced broken covenant can still model authentic love for their
children by:


  • Acknowledging failures without making excuses or blaming
    others
  • Seeking reconciliation where possible, even if restoration
    isn’t achievable
  • Living faithfully in their current state, whether single, remar-
    ried, or separated
  • Teaching truth about authentic love, even when their own
    lives haven’t perfectly reflected it
  • Modeling permanence that teaches children love is reliable
  • Demonstrating fidelity that shows children promises can be
    kept
  • Providing security that allows children to develop healthy
    attachment
  • Teaching sacrifice that prepares children for the cost of au-
    thentic love
  • Pointing to God’s covenant as the ultimate source of healing
    and hope


When parents live authentic covenant love, they heal not only their
own relationship but also the wounds of previous generations, creating
a legacy of love that will bless their children and grandchildren.

A.7 Practical Applications for Marriage

For Engaged Couples:

   • Understand marriage as a covenant, not a contract
   • Prepare for permanent commitment, not just a wedding
   • Learn about Natural Family Planning as an expression of
     covenant love
   • Seek pre-marriage counseling that addresses covenant expecta-
     tions
   • Choose a spouse who understands and embraces covenant love



For Married Couples:

   • Renew your wedding vows regularly, both formally and in daily
     choice
   • Reject contraception and embrace the fruitfulness of marriage
   • Prioritize your marriage relationship as the foundation of your
     family
   • Seek help when struggling rather than considering divorce
   • Model covenant fidelity for your children through your treat-
     ment of each other
   • Remember that your marriage is a sacrament, not just a human
     relationship



For Divorced Catholics:

   • Understand that civil divorce doesn’t dissolve the sacramental
     bond
   • Seek Church guidance about your situation through a qualified
     priest or deacon
   • Consider pursuing a declaration of nullity if there are grounds
   • Focus on living faithfully in your current state
   • Avoid remarriage without proper Church approval
   • Work to heal the wounds caused by broken covenant

A.9 Conclusion
The marriage covenant is under unprecedented attack in our time,
but the Church’s teaching remains clear and unchanging. Marriage is

                                 275
Appendix A Appendix: The Marriage Covenant - Defending God’s Plan for
Human Love


the union of one man and one woman, ordered toward the procreation
and education of children, and indissoluble until death.

This teaching is not harsh but merciful—it protects children, strength-
ens families, and witnesses to the world about God’s own covenant
love. When Catholics live authentic marriage covenants, they become
living signs of God’s faithfulness and create the stable families that
are the foundation of healthy societies.

In a world of broken promises and disposable relationships, the mar-
riage covenant shines as a beacon of hope, proving that permanent,
faithful love is not only possible but the path to deepest joy and
fulfillment.

B.1 The Critical Window:                            Why Early
    Love Matters
Unlike the natural virtues we explored in previous chapters, the Cross
and Resurrection represent revealed truths that children cannot un-
derstand instinctively. The mystery of God’s love poured out for our
salvation must be taught, explained, and most importantly, lived out
by the adults who love them.

But how exactly does this transmission happen? Why do some chil-
dren grow up with a deep capacity for authentic love while others

                                  278
      Appendix B Appendix: How Adults Make Divine Love Clear to Children


struggle with disordered attachments and broken relationships? The
answer lies in understanding both the psychology of child development
and the theology of how God’s love works through nature.




B.2      How Children Learn Divine Mystery
         Through Human Love

The Psychology of Spiritual Learning

Child development research reveals that children understand abstract
concepts by building on concrete experiences. A child cannot compre-
hend “God’s love” as an abstract idea, but they can experience what
love feels like when a parent comforts them in the night, forgives their
mistakes, or keeps promises even when it’s diﬀicult.


These repeated experiences create what psychologists call “internal
working models”—mental frameworks that help children understand
how relationships work. When children experience authentic love con-
sistently, their brains literally develop neural pathways that prepare
them to recognize and receive divine love.


The Critical Research Finding: George Barna’s research shows
that worldview is formed between ages 18 months and 13 years. By
age 13 or 14, a child’s fundamental understanding of how the world
works—including how love works—is essentially set.¹ This means par-
ents have roughly 12 years to lay the foundation for their child’s
capacity to understand and receive authentic love.


The security, trust, and attachment children form with loving parents
creates the emotional and cognitive foundation for understanding God
as a loving Father. This is why children from stable, loving homes
often find it easier to trust God, while children from broken or abusive
homes may struggle with the concept of divine love—their internal
working models have been shaped by different experiences.

                                  279
Appendix B Appendix: How Adults Make Divine Love Clear to Children


The Attachment Foundation
John Bowlby’s groundbreaking research on attachment theory reveals
why early relationships are so crucial. As he documented, complete
deprivation of love in early childhood has “far-reaching effects on
character development and may entirely cripple the capacity to make
relationships.”

This isn’t just about emotional health—it’s about spiritual capacity.
Children who experience secure attachment develop: - The ability to
trust - The capacity to receive love - The willingness to be vulnerable
- The understanding that relationships can be safe and permanent -
The internal sense that they are worthy of love

These capacities are essential for receiving divine love. A child who
has never experienced unconditional love will struggle to believe that
God loves them unconditionally. A child who has been abandoned
will find it diﬀicult to trust that God will never leave them.

The Devastating Impact of Disordered Love: When children
experience inconsistent, conditional, or abusive “love,” they develop
disordered internal models. They may learn that: - Love must be
earned through performance - Relationships are fundamentally unsafe
- They are not worthy of genuine care - Love always comes with strings
attached - People who claim to love you will eventually hurt you

These disordered models don’t just affect human relationships—they
create barriers to understanding divine love. The child who learned
that love is conditional will struggle to believe in God’s unconditional
love. The child who experienced abandonment will find it hard to
trust in God’s faithfulness.


Grace Working Through Nature
Catholic theology teaches that grace builds on nature, and this prin-
ciple is especially clear in child development. God doesn’t bypass the
natural process of human development but works through it. The
Holy Spirit uses authentic human love as a kind of “sacramental
preparation”—visible signs that point toward invisible realities.

                                  280
      Appendix B Appendix: How Adults Make Divine Love Clear to Children


When parents love their children with genuine sacrifice, mercy, and
faithfulness, they are not just being good parents—they are cooper-
ating with God’s grace to prepare their children’s hearts to recognize
these same qualities in Christ’s love.

The Sacramental Nature of Parental Love: - The child who has
experienced forgiveness from loving parents has the experiential foun-
dation to understand Christ’s forgiveness - The child who has seen par-
ents sacrifice for the family’s good can grasp why Jesus would sacrifice
Himself for humanity’s good - The child who has witnessed covenant
faithfulness between parents can understand the permanence of God’s
love - The child who has received mercy after wrongdoing can com-
prehend divine mercy

This is why the quality of human love matters so much in spiritual
formation. Authentic love creates the proper foundation; distorted
or conditional love creates confusion that must later be healed before
the child can properly understand divine love.



B.3      From Concrete to Abstract: The De-
         velopmental Bridge

Early Childhood (Ages 2-6): The Foundation Years
Young children think very concretely—they understand love through
hugs, food, protection, and presence. When a parent gets up at night
for a sick child, the young child doesn’t think “this is sacrificial love”—
they simply experience being cared for and feel secure.

What they’re learning: - I am safe - I am loved - My needs matter
- Someone bigger and stronger protects me - Love means presence and
care

How this prepares them for divine love: - God as protector and
provider - The security of being God’s beloved child - Trust in divine
providence

                                   281
Appendix B Appendix: How Adults Make Divine Love Clear to Children


Middle Childhood (Ages 7-11): Pattern Recogni-
tion
As children mature, they begin to recognize patterns and make con-
nections. They start to notice that love involves choices—Mom chose
to help me instead of watching her show, Dad chose to keep his
promise even though he was tired. They begin to understand that
love sometimes costs something.

What they’re learning: - Love involves sacrifice - People choose to
love - Love requires commitment - Love sometimes means saying no -
Love is more than feelings

How this prepares them for divine love: - Understanding that
God chose to love us - Grasping that love requires sacrifice - Recog-
nizing that divine love involves both mercy and justice


Adolescence (Ages 12-18): Abstract Understanding
Adolescents can finally grasp abstract concepts and make theological
connections. Now they can understand that their parents’ sacrifices
were expressions of love, and they can connect this to Christ’s sacrifice
on the Cross. But this abstract understanding is only meaningful
because it’s built on years of concrete experiences.

What they can now understand: - The theological meaning of sac-
rifice - The integration of justice and mercy - The concept of covenant
love - The mystery of the Cross and Resurrection

The crucial insight: If the foundation wasn’t properly laid in the
earlier years, adolescents will struggle to make these connections au-
thentically. They may understand the concepts intellectually but lack
the experiential foundation to receive them deeply.


B.4 The Imitation and Resonance Pro-
    cess
Children also learn through what neuroscientists call “mirror
neurons”—they literally mirror the emotions and behaviors they

                                  282
      Appendix B Appendix: How Adults Make Divine Love Clear to Children


observe.� When children see parents forgive each other, their brains
are learning the pattern of forgiveness. When they observe parents
keeping commitments despite diﬀiculty, they’re internalizing the
pattern of covenant faithfulness.

This mirroring happens at both conscious and unconscious levels.
Children absorb not just what parents say but how they say it, not
just what they do but the spirit in which they do it. A parent who
forgives grudgingly teaches a different lesson than a parent who for-
gives with genuine mercy. Children’s hearts are remarkably sensitive
to authenticity—they can sense whether love is genuine or performed.


B.5      Age-Appropriate Revelation
Understanding these developmental realities helps us see why the
same parental actions teach different lessons at different stages:

Ages 3-6: Parental sacrifice teaches “I am safe and loved” Ages 7-
11: The same sacrifice teaches “Love involves choosing others’ good”
Ages 12-16: The same sacrifice teaches “This is what Christ did for
us” Ages 17+: The same sacrifice teaches “This is how I should love
others”

Each stage builds on the previous one. The teenager who can make
the theological connection to Christ’s sacrifice can only do so because
they first experienced being loved unconditionally as a small child.


B.6      Practical Applications:                     Living the
         Cross for Children
With this understanding of how children learn, we can see how specific
adult actions create the experiential foundation for understanding the
Cross and Resurrection:


When we make sacrifices for our children
They begin to understand that love sometimes requires giving up
what we want for the good of others. A parent who gets up in the

                                 283
Appendix B Appendix: How Adults Make Divine Love Clear to Children


middle of the night for a sick child, who works extra hours to provide
for the family, who gives up personal pleasures for their children’s
needs—these sacrifices help children understand that Jesus’ sacrifice
on the Cross flows from the same love.



When we forgive those who hurt us
Children see that mercy is stronger than revenge. Parents who forgive
each other after arguments, who show kindness to diﬀicult relatives,
who pray for those who have wronged the family—these acts of mercy
help children understand Jesus’ prayer: “Father, forgive them, for
they know not what they do” (Luke 23:34).



When we keep our promises even when it’s diﬀicult
Children learn that covenant love is permanent. Parents who stay
married through hard times, who keep their word even when it
costs them, who remain faithful to their commitments—these acts of
covenant fidelity help children understand why Jesus stayed on the
Cross when He could have come down.



When we live the sacramental life faithfully
Children encounter the fruits of the Cross and Resurrection in their
daily experience. Parents who attend Mass regularly, who go to Con-
fession, who pray together as a family—these practices make the grace
of the Paschal Mystery tangible and real in children’s lives.



When we speak truth with love
Children learn that authentic love never compromises with evil but
always seeks the good of the other. Parents who correct their chil-
dren lovingly, who teach moral truth clearly, who stand up for what
is right—these acts help children understand that Jesus’ death was
necessary because sin is real and love demands justice.

                                  284
      Appendix B Appendix: How Adults Make Divine Love Clear to Children


When we demonstrate resurrection hope
Children learn that love is ultimately victorious. Parents who face
diﬀiculties with hope, who find meaning in suffering, who celebrate
the new life that comes from sacrifice—these attitudes help children
understand that the Cross leads to Resurrection and that love always
has the final word.


B.7      The Healing of Disordered Love
For children who have experienced broken or disordered love, all is
not lost. The Church offers healing through:

The Sacraments: Baptism creates new spiritual parentage; the Eu-
charist provides ongoing nourishment; Confession offers repeated for-
giveness and healing.

Spiritual Adoption: Godparents, teachers, mentors, and other
adults can provide corrective experiences of authentic love.

Community: The Church as family can surround children with ex-
amples of healthy relationships and authentic love.

Grace: The Holy Spirit can heal wounds and create new capacity for
love, even when natural development was disrupted.

But prevention is always better than cure. This is why our under-
standing of perfect love is so crucial—not just for our own spiritual
growth, but for our mission as parents, teachers, and mentors.


B.8      The Sacred Responsibility
This research reveals the immense responsibility and privilege of those
who love children. We are not just caring for their immediate needs—
we are shaping their capacity to receive and give authentic love for
the rest of their lives. We are preparing their hearts to understand
the greatest love story ever told: the Cross and Resurrection of Jesus
Christ.

When we truly understand what love means, we can help children

                                 285
Appendix B Appendix: How Adults Make Divine Love Clear to Children


grasp the profound mystery of the Paschal Mystery through our own
lived witness. We become living explanations of divine love, making
visible through our daily choices the same integration of truth, justice,
mercy, sacrifice, and covenant that Jesus demonstrated on Calvary
and validated through His Resurrection.

The stakes could not be higher. As George Barna’s research shows,
we have roughly 12 years to lay this foundation. After that, the basic
patterns are set. This is why the Church has always emphasized the
crucial importance of Christian marriage and family life—not as one
option among many, but as the primary school of love where children
learn to recognize and receive the love of God.

“The family is the first and vital cell of society… It is in the family
that children learn the first and most important lessons about love,
sacrifice, forgiveness, and faithfulness. What they learn there—or fail
to learn—will shape their capacity for authentic relationships for the
rest of their lives.” — The wisdom of the Church on family life

May we who have been entrusted with children understand the sacred
nature of our calling and live in such a way that the children in our
care grow up with hearts prepared to receive the perfect love revealed
in Christ’s Cross and Resurrection.

“Faith Alone” vs “God’s
Perfect Love alone”

To my dear brothers and sisters in Christ—especially those who con-
fess that we are justified by faith alone—receive this as a humble
offering of gratitude and hope. We all look to the same crucified and
risen Lord. We all rely upon the same grace. We all long for the
same communion with the Father in the Spirit. If I argue for “God’s
Perfect Love alone” as the deepest truth of the gospel, I do so not to
erase “faith alone,” but to fulfill what “faith alone” most truly desires:
to be bound to Jesus by the very Love that is God.


The question in good faith
“Faith alone” insists—beautifully—that salvation is God’s work, not
our boast. It is a protest against fear, performance, and spiritual
bookkeeping. It magnifies Christ, exalts the suﬀiciency of His cross,
and protects the conscience: “Whoever believes in Him shall not per-
ish but have eternal life” (John 3:16).

“God’s Perfect Love alone” insists that the same God who justifies by
grace also indwells, heals, and transforms by grace, such that the end
for which we are made is not merely acquittal, but communion: to
“abide” in Christ and bear fruit (John 15), to become what we behold

                                   288
                    Appendix C “Faith Alone” vs “God’s Perfect Love alone”


(2 Corinthians 3:18). It is not Love versus faith; it is Love embracing
faith and bringing it to its fullness.


What “faith alone” seeks to safeguard
   • The primacy of grace: We do not climb to God. God descends
     to us (Ephesians 2:8–9).
   • The suﬀiciency of Christ: His obedience, not ours, is our righ-
     teousness (Romans 5:19).
   • The relief of conscience: Trust anchors us in God’s mercy, not
     in our fluctuating merits.

These are treasures every Christian should cherish.           A humble
Catholic heart can say “amen.”


What “God’s Perfect Love alone” seeks to reveal
Scripture teaches that God is Love (1 John 4:8). Love is not merely
a divine feeling; it is God’s very Being poured out in the Son and the
Spirit. Because Love is first, Love is also last: “Love never ends” (1
Corinthians 13:8). And because Love is first and last, Love is also
the form—the living shape—of the believer’s life now: “faith working
through love” (Galatians 5:6).

To say “God’s Perfect Love alone” is to confess that:

   • The source of salvation is Love: “God so loved the world…”
     (John 3:16).
   • The way of salvation is Love: “Abide in my love… keep my
     commandments” (John 15:9–10).
   • The end of salvation is Love: “And now these three remain:
     faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love” (1
     Corinthians 13:13).

Love is thus not a rival principle beside faith, but the divine life into
which faith introduces us. Faith is the open hand that receives Christ;
Love is Christ’s own life poured into the heart by the Spirit (Romans
5:5).

                                  289
Appendix C “Faith Alone” vs “God’s Perfect Love alone”


The biblical pattern: one grace, three theological
virtues

Scripture and the great Christian tradition speak of faith, hope, and
love together (1 Corinthians 13:13). They are not competing ladders
but a single grace unfolding:


   • Faith receives Christ.
   • Hope anchors us in God’s promises.
   • Love unites us to God and neighbor in Christ.


James warns against a “faith” without love: “Faith by itself, if it does
not have works, is dead” (James 2:17). Paul warns against “works”
without love: “If I give away all I have…but have not love, I gain
nothing” (1 Corinthians 13:3). The apostles are not contradicting
each other; they are guarding a single mystery from opposite cliffs.
The heartbeat of the New Testament is that the faith that justifies is
the faith that loves, because the Justifier Himself indwells the believer
and loves in and through them (Galatians 2:20).




Clarifying “works”: not wages, but communion

When the New Testament rejects “works,” it rejects the idea that
God’s favor can be earned by human effort. But when it commands
works of love, it calls us to participate in Christ’s own life. These
“works” are not wages; they are wedding-life—signs that the Vine is
alive in the branches (John 15:1–8). If Love is in us, Love acts. If
Love acts in us, all the glory goes to God.


Thus, to say “God’s Perfect Love alone” is to confess that any true
good we do is God’s Love moving us. Our cooperation is real, but
Love is anterior, empowering, and triumphant. “It is God who works
in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure” (Philippians
2:13).

                    Appendix C “Faith Alone” vs “God’s Perfect Love alone”


Mercy’s logic: justification and sanctification as one
embrace
Viewed within Love, justification and sanctification are not rival op-
erations but two notes of the same music: God declares the sinner
righteous in Christ and simultaneously begins to make the sinner righ-
teous by Christ. The declaration heals; the healing declares. Christ is
our righteousness (1 Corinthians 1:30), and the Spirit conforms us to
Him (Romans 8:29). The emphasis may differ among Christians, but
the melody is one: the redeemed become like the Redeemer because
His Love is not only for us but in us.


Why language matters—and why Love is larger
Many Protestants clarify: “Faith alone justifies, but the faith that
justifies is never alone.” Catholics clarify: “We are justified by grace
through faith, and this faith is enlivened and formed by love” (Gala-
tians 5:6). Both mean to deny Pelagianism, both mean to confess
grace, both mean to exalt Christ.

So why speak of “God’s Perfect Love alone”? Because Scripture itself
places Love as both origin and goal, form and fulfillment. Faith is
indispensable—as sight is indispensable to a journey. But the desti-
nation is Love: God Himself, and union with Him. Faith is ordered to
Love as seed to fruit, promise to fulfillment, engagement to marriage
supper (Revelation 19:7–9). Every gift of God’s grace is, from first
to last, the self-gift of the God who is Love.


Practical convergence: one life, one witness
  • In prayer: Faith trusts; Love abides. We come boldly to the
    throne of grace (Hebrews 4:16) and linger there because Love
    welcomes us.
  • In moral life: Faith hears; Love obeys. “If you love me, you will
    keep my commandments” (John 14:15). Obedience is not a fee;
    it is fidelity in friendship (John 15:14–15).
  • In suffering: Faith clings; Love endures. “The love of Christ con-
    trols us” (2 Corinthians 5:14), and so we endure trials, knowing

                                  291
Appendix C “Faith Alone” vs “God’s Perfect Love alone”


     that nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ
     Jesus (Romans 8:39).
   • In mission: Faith proclaims; Love persuades. We preach Christ
     crucified, and we become, by grace, living parables of His mercy
     (Matthew 5:14–16).


A gentle plea
If you confess “faith alone,” keep confessing it with the breadth Scrip-
ture gives it: a living faith that works through love because Love Him-
self has taken up residence in your heart. And if you confess “God’s
Perfect Love alone,” remember that Love Himself has ordained faith
as Love’s doorway, hope as Love’s anchor, the sacraments as Love’s
touch, and the Church as Love’s household.

Let us, then, not stand in rival camps shouting slogans across a valley
Christ has bridged with His own Body. Instead, let us stand together
under the Cross, where Love shows us what Love means: “Greater
love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his
friends” (John 15:13). From that Cross, He gives us His Spirit, who
pours God’s love into our hearts (Romans 5:5), so that the world
might know we are His disciples—by our love (John 13:35).


Final word
Faith magnifies Christ by trusting Him. Love magnifies Christ by
becoming like Him. The gospel magnifies Christ by uniting us to
Him. If we must choose a single banner to fly over all, let it be
the one Scripture flies: “the greatest of these is love” (1 Corinthians
13:13). Not because faith is small, but because faith’s greatness is to
hand us over to Love, and Love’s greatness is to hand us over to God.

May the God who is Love perfect our faith, sustain our hope, and
crown us with Himself.

—In charity and gratitude, a servant of the Love that has first loved
us (1 John 4:19)

D.3 Foundational Definitions
TRUTH
Reality as God sees it; what actually is and what actually serves
others’ genuine good. Truth is not subjective opinion but objective
reality that exists independently of our feelings or preferences. It
includes both factual accuracy and moral reality - what is right and
wrong according to God’s eternal law.

Examples: A parent telling a child that stealing is wrong, even when
the child doesn’t want to hear it. A doctor giving an accurate diag-
nosis, even when it’s diﬀicult news. A friend speaking honestly about
harmful behavior, even when it risks the friendship. The Church
teaching moral truth, even when it’s unpopular in the culture.


JUSTICE
Setting things right according to truth; giving each person what they
are owed according to their dignity and circumstances. Justice in-
cludes proper relationships, fair treatment, moral order, and protect-
ing the rights of all people, especially the vulnerable.

Examples: A judge sentencing a criminal with punishment that fits
the crime. Parents disciplining children fairly and consistently. An
employer paying workers a just wage for their labor. A government
protecting the rights of all citizens, especially the weak and defense-
less.

                                  295
Appendix D Theological Vocabulary for Love, Righteousness, and Salvation


MERCY
Compassionate response to need that goes beyond what justice
requires; healing, restoration, and patient forbearance with human
weakness. Mercy doesn’t violate justice but transcends it with
generous love, offering forgiveness and second chances.

Examples: A parent forgiving a child who has genuinely repented
of wrongdoing. A victim choosing to forgive their offender and work
for their rehabilitation. A teacher giving extra help to a struggling
student. God offering forgiveness to sinners through the sacraments.


SACRIFICE
The sacred, costly gift of self for the good of another; giving up some-
thing valuable for the sake of love. Sacrifice is what makes love con-
crete and real - it’s the moment when love stops being just words or
feelings and becomes action that costs us something.

Examples: Parents losing sleep to care for a sick child. A soldier
risking his life to protect civilians. A spouse working extra hours
to support the family. Christ giving His life on the Cross for our
salvation. A priest taking vows of celibacy to serve God’s people.


TRUTH + JUSTICE + MERCY (INTEGRATED)
The three inseparable divine attributes that must be held together
and expressed through sacrifice for love to exist. These cannot violate
each other and must all be present for authentic love.

Examples of proper integration: A judge sentencing a criminal
with appropriate punishment (justice) while ensuring the sentence fits
the actual crime (truth) and includes opportunities for rehabilitation
(mercy). A parent disciplining a child by addressing the real behav-
ior problem (truth) with fair consequences (justice) delivered with
patience and explanation (mercy).

Examples of dangerous separation: Truth without mercy =
harsh legalism that crushes people with unrealistic demands. Justice
without truth = arbitrary punishment based on false accusations or

                                    296
    Appendix D Theological Vocabulary for Love, Righteousness, and Salvation


popular opinion. Mercy without justice = enabling harmful behavior
by refusing to address real problems.


LOVE (God’s Perfect Love)
The sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant, binding truth, justice, and
mercy into life-giving communion. Love is not an emotion but God’s
own nature expressed through sacrifice for the good of another, cre-
ating permanent bonds that generate and sustain life.

Examples: A mother staying awake all night caring for her sick child,
even when exhausted. A businessman refusing to cheat customers
despite financial pressure, because it would harm them. A soldier
risking his life to save civilians, not for glory but because protecting
others is his duty. A priest taking vows of poverty and celibacy to
serve God’s people without personal gain.


WORKING GOOD (Righteousness)
Actively choosing to express complete truth+justice+mercy for oth-
ers’ benefit at our own expense. This is our fundamental duty as
creatures made in God’s image. We can only do this through God’s
grace, but when we cooperate with that grace, we are actually working
good - like a soldier serving his country out of duty, not for personal
reward.

Examples: A teacher patiently explaining diﬀicult concepts to strug-
gling students, even staying after hours without extra pay. Parents
waking up repeatedly during the night to care for a newborn, sacri-
ficing sleep for their child’s welfare. A government oﬀicial making
unpopular but necessary decisions for the common good, knowing it
may cost them politically. An employee working honestly even when
supervisors aren’t watching, because integrity serves everyone better
than cheating.


WORKING EVIL (Sin)
Actively choosing to work incomplete or perverted good (fractured
truth+justice+mercy) for our own benefit at others’ expense. This

                                   297
Appendix D Theological Vocabulary for Love, Righteousness, and Salvation


violates our created purpose and breaks communion with God and
neighbor.

Examples: A businessman lying about product quality to increase
profits, using partial truth to deceive customers. A parent being per-
missive about harmful behavior to avoid conflict, showing false mercy
that damages the child’s development. A judge showing favoritism to
wealthy defendants, perverting justice for personal or political gain.
Someone spreading gossip that contains some truth but lacks mercy
and damages relationships.

D.4       Salvation and Grace
GRACE
God’s unmerited gift of His own divine life and power working within
us, making it possible for us to fulfill our created purpose of working
good. Without grace, we can only work incomplete good for selfish
purposes. Grace heals our broken capacity to love truly, teaches us
what working good looks like, and empowers us to choose righteous-
ness.

How grace works: First, it heals our broken capacity to love truly.
Then it teaches us (through Christ, Scripture, and Church) what
working good actually looks like in our specific circumstances. Finally,
it empowers us to choose righteousness out of duty and love rather
than selfish calculation.

Important distinction: Grace doesn’t do our choosing for us (we
must freely cooperate) but makes righteous choosing possible. Like
a doctor who heals our vision - we must still choose to look and see,
but now we actually can.


SALVATION
God’s complete healing of our capacity to work good through His
grace. Not merely legal forgiveness but actual restoration of our abil-

                                    298
    Appendix D Theological Vocabulary for Love, Righteousness, and Salvation


ity to fulfill our created purpose of working truth+justice+mercy for
others. Like a skilled physician healing a broken limb - we are actually
made whole and able to function as designed.

What salvation includes: Healing from the damage sin has done to
our ability to love; teaching us how to work good through Scripture,
Church, and grace; empowering us to fulfill our duties righteously;
and restoring our communion with God and neighbor.

What salvation is NOT: A legal transaction that leaves us
unchanged; a license to live however we want; something we earn
through good behavior; or merely getting a ticket to heaven while
remaining the same person.


FAITH
Trusting dependence on God’s gift of His perfect love (truth+justice+mercy),
which heals us from working evil and enables us to work good. Faith
is not mere intellectual belief but complete reliance on God’s power
to transform us. True faith is always accompanied by righteous
works - they are inseparable aspects of the same reality.

What faith includes:          Believing that God’s way of love
(truth+justice+mercy) is truly good; trusting that God can
and will heal our capacity to work good; depending on God’s teach-
ing rather than our own wisdom; and committing to live according
to our created purpose through actual working good for others.

How faith works: Like a patient trusting a surgeon - we believe
the doctor can heal us, we submit to the treatment process, and we
follow the rehabilitation by actually exercising the healed limb. Faith
without the “exercise” of good works is not true faith, just as good
works without faith are not truly good.


CONVERSION
The fundamental turning from working evil (incomplete good for self)
to working good (complete truth+justice+mercy for others). Not
merely intellectual assent or emotional experience, but a reorientation
of the will toward fulfilling our created purpose through faithful duty.

                                   299
Appendix D Theological Vocabulary for Love, Righteousness, and Salvation


The moment when we begin to depend on God’s grace rather than
selfish schemes.

^ Back to Contents


D.5       The Fundamental Principle
Every human choice is either righteousness (working complete good
for others through God’s grace) or sin (working incomplete good for
self). Salvation heals our capacity for righteousness. Christian life
is learning to fulfill this capacity through faithful duty in our God-
given vocation. Faith and works are inseparable aspects of this grace-
enabled life of love.
