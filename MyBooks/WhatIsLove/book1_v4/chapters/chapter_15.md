## The Question No One Asks

In every debate about love, freedom, identity, and rights, there is one question almost never asked: *What about the children?*

Adults debate autonomy, equality, personal authenticity, and happiness. They craft sophisticated arguments for their choices, citing rights and freedoms. Meanwhile, children suffer the consequences of adult decisions—inheriting broken worldviews, broken families, and broken faith. Society wonders why children struggle while refusing to connect cause and effect.

This isn't just about ideas—it's about real children experiencing real suffering. Not just one generation—these wounds compound across generations, creating cascading destruction that threatens civilization itself.

The test of any "love" is simple: **Does it give children what they need to flourish?** In the previous chapter, we examined various counterfeits and showed what each is missing. Now we apply the ultimate test: What do they do to children? The answer is devastating. Every single counterfeit harms children in predictable ways because each is missing essential components of God's Perfect Love.

Jesus' words are uncompromising: causing little ones to stumble merits the harshest judgment. Their angels behold the Father's face. Children are not collateral damage in adult ideological battles—they are persons with sacred dignity, rights, and needs that authentic love must protect and nurture.

## What Children Need to Flourish

Before examining how counterfeits fail, we must understand what children actually need. God's Perfect Love provides six essential components:

**1. Truth - Knowing Reality:** Children need to understand the world as it actually is. "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it" (Proverbs 22:6). Confusion about reality creates anxiety and inability to navigate life. God's Perfect Love provides objective truth grounded in God's design.

**2. Justice - Security and Protection:** Children need to know they have rights, dignity, and protection. "Give justice to the weak and the fatherless; maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute" (Psalm 82:3). Without justice, children are vulnerable to exploitation. God's Perfect Love provides recognition of sacred dignity, rights to mother and father, and protection through covenant.

**3. Mercy - Healing When Things Go Wrong:** Children need forgiveness, second chances, and restoration. "The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases, his mercies never come to an end" (Lamentations 3:22). Without mercy, children carry wounds that never heal. God's Perfect Love provides compassionate forgiveness that calls to conversion and healing.

**4. Sacrifice - Adults Who Put Children First:** Children need parents willing to give up personal desires for their good. "Do nothing from selfishness or conceit, but in humility count others better than yourselves" (Philippians 2:3). Without sacrifice, children are abandoned when costly. God's Perfect Love provides self-giving love that prioritizes children's needs over adult desires.

**5. Covenant - Stable, Permanent Relationships:** Children need to know their family won't dissolve, that promises are kept. "Has not the one God made and sustained for us the spirit of life? And what does he desire? Godly offspring" (Malachi 2:15). Without covenant, children live in constant insecurity. God's Perfect Love provides binding promises that create safety.

**6. Life-Giving Communion - Belonging to Family and Community:** Children need to be part of something larger than themselves. The family is the domestic church (Ephesians 6:1-4). Without communion, children are isolated. God's Perfect Love provides generational bonds, extended family, and Church community.

Children need ALL six components working together. Remove any one, and children suffer. This is why counterfeit love always harms children—it's missing essential components.

## The Pattern of Generational Destruction

In the previous chapter, we examined the landscape of counterfeit love. Now we apply the ultimate test: Do they protect and nurture children? The answer is devastating. Every single counterfeit harms children in predictable ways because each is missing essential components of God's Perfect Love.

We can map exactly what's missing—and see precisely how children suffer as a result. For each category, we'll show the pattern of distortion, then explain how children suffer across generations.

### Category 1: Counterfeits That Kill or Sterilize Children

**The Ultimate Harm - Denying Life Itself**

| Counterfeit | Distorts Truth | Distorts Justice | Distorts Mercy | Distorts Sacrifice | Result for Children |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Abortion** | Denies child is person | Denies child's right to life | Kills instead of healing | Adult avoids cost by killing child | Death itself—60M+ eliminated |
| **Gender Ideology** | Denies biological reality of body | Denies child's right to intact body | Affirms lie instead of calling to truth | Sterilizes child for adult ideology | Sterilization, cannot become parents |

**The Generational Impact:**

These two counterfeits represent the ultimate harm to children: denying their very existence or their future ability to exist. Adults debate autonomy and identity while children suffer death or sterilization.

Abortion eliminates 60+ million children in America alone—an entire generation lost. Families that will never exist. Grandchildren never born. Bloodlines ended. The child's right to life—the most fundamental justice—is denied completely. The mother's crisis is "solved" by killing the child. Adults avoid the cost of parenthood through the ultimate sacrifice: the child's life.

Gender ideology sterilizes children before they can understand the permanent consequences, destroying their future as parents. Children are told their bodies are wrong, that biological reality is negotiable. They undergo irreversible medical interventions that eliminate their fertility. Adults celebrate "authenticity" while children lose the ability to create the next generation.

Both deny fundamental truth, violate justice, pervert mercy (killing/mutilating instead of healing), and demand children sacrifice their lives or fertility for adult ideology. The generational impact is catastrophic: entire bloodlines eliminated, families that will never exist, civilization's future destroyed at its source.

### Category 2: Counterfeits That Destroy Family Structure

**Breaking the Bonds That Protect Children**

| Counterfeit | Distorts Truth | Distorts Justice | Distorts Mercy | Distorts Sacrifice | Result for Children |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Cohabitation** | Pretends commitment unnecessary | Denies children's right to covenant security | No healing of instability | Adults avoid cost of binding vows | Instability, abandonment, insecurity |
| **No-Fault Divorce** | "Happiness" trumps covenant permanence | Denies children's right to intact family | No perseverance through difficulty | Adults escape when costly | Devastating loss, profound grief |
| **Divorce with Children** | Ignores children's need for both parents | Violates children's right to mother AND father | Forces children to "choose" sides | Adults prioritize desires over children | Torn loyalties, lifelong wounds |
| **Same-Sex "Marriage"** | Denies complementarity necessary | Intentionally deprives child of mother or father | Treats child as commodity | Adults prioritize desires over children's rights | Denied complementary formation |

**The Generational Impact:**

Five counterfeits systematically destroy the family structure children depend upon for security and formation. The pattern is clear: adults debate their rights to happiness, autonomy, and self-definition while children suffer the shattering of their world.

Cohabitation refuses binding promises, leaving children vulnerable to abandonment. Cohabiting couples break up at far higher rates than married couples. Children in these relationships never know if their family will still exist tomorrow. They learn that commitment is optional, promises are negotiable, and love doesn't require sacrifice.

Divorce breaks the covenant children depend upon, forcing them to shuttle between homes with torn loyalties and lifelong wounds. "Mom's house" and "Dad's house" replace "home." Holidays become negotiations. Children feel responsible for the breakup, guilty for loving both parents, anxious about the future. The adults who promised "till death do us part" broke that promise, teaching children that no promise can be trusted.

Same-sex "marriage" intentionally deprives children of either mother or father. Children are purchased through surrogacy or artificial insemination, deliberately separated from biological parents, denied the complementary love and formation that only the union of man and woman provides. Adults claim "love is love" while children pay the price of motherlessness or fatherlessness by design.

All five distort truth (pretending commitment unnecessary, denying children's needs), violate justice (denying children's rights to stable family), pervert mercy (no perseverance, no healing), and demand children sacrifice their security for adult autonomy.

**Generational impact:** Children who never learn covenant fidelity repeat the pattern, creating cascading family breakdown across generations. The domestic church—the first school of love—is shattered, leaving children unable to form their own stable families.

### Category 3: Counterfeits That Damage Parents' Ability to Love

**Poisoning the Source**

| Counterfeit | Distorts Truth | Distorts Justice | Distorts Mercy | Distorts Sacrifice | Result for Children |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Pornography** | Treats persons as objects for consumption | Denies dignity of persons used | No healing, only exploitation | Adults pursue pleasure over family bonds | Emotional absence, broken marriages, addiction passed down |
| **Hookup Culture** | Pretends sex without commitment is harmless | Denies children's right to committed parents | No healing from exploitation | Adults avoid cost of permanent bonds | Born into instability, no models of authentic love |

**The Generational Impact:**

These counterfeits poison the source—damaging parents' ability to love their own children. Adults debate free speech and sexual autonomy while children suffer the consequences of parents' broken capacity for authentic intimacy.

Pornography addicts parents to fantasy, creating emotional absence, broken marriages, and modeling objectification that damages children's future relationships. The father addicted to pornography cannot be fully present to his wife or children. His mind is elsewhere, his capacity for real intimacy destroyed. When the addiction is discovered, marriages crumble. Children lose their father—not to death, but to pixels on a screen. They learn that persons are objects, that intimacy is performance, that love is consumption.

Hookup culture leaves children born into instability without committed fathers, raised by mothers damaged by repeated exploitation, inheriting a culture that has forgotten how to form lasting families. The child conceived in a hookup is often unwanted, sometimes aborted, occasionally born into a single-parent home where the mother struggles alone. The father is absent—never committed, never bound by covenant, never willing to sacrifice for his child. The child grows up without models of authentic love, without witnessing covenant fidelity, without learning how to form a stable family.

Both distort truth (treating persons as objects, pretending sex without commitment is harmless), violate justice (denying dignity and children's rights), pervert mercy (exploitation instead of healing), and demand children sacrifice their security for adult pleasure.

**Generational impact:** Addiction and brokenness passed down, children unable to form healthy families because they never witnessed authentic love. The cycle repeats, each generation more damaged than the last.

### Category 4: Counterfeits That Destroy Children's Grasp of Truth

**Reality Denied, Children Confused**

| Counterfeit | Distorts Truth | Distorts Justice | Distorts Mercy | Distorts Sacrifice | Result for Children |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Postmodernism** | Denies objective truth exists | No objective standards for right/wrong | Cannot call to truth if no truth exists | No cost to hold contradictory views | Cannot discern truth from opinion, moral paralysis |
| **Wokeism** | Reality subordinate to feelings | Objective standards replaced by power dynamics | Affirms sin instead of calling to conversion | Children sacrifice conscience to affirm lies | Forced to affirm falsehoods, victim mentality over virtue |
| **Relativism** | "My truth" replaces objective truth | No shared moral foundation | Cannot heal if no objective good exists | No cost to create own "truth" | No moral compass, contradictory "truths" create confusion |

**The Generational Impact:**

Four counterfeits systematically destroy children's ability to grasp objective truth, leaving them unable to navigate reality. Adults debate power structures, inclusion, and personal authenticity while children suffer profound confusion about what is real.

Postmodernism denies objective truth exists, leaving children unable to discern truth from opinion in moral paralysis. When teachers tell children "there is no objective truth, only perspectives," children lose the ability to call anything truly wrong. Bullying? Just a perspective. Cheating? Just a different interpretation. Murder? Just one narrative among many. Children are left morally paralyzed, unable to stand for anything.

Wokeism subordinates reality to feelings, forcing children to affirm what they know is false and developing victim mentality over virtue. Children are told that a boy who identifies as a girl IS a girl, that to question this is violence, that compassion requires celebrating sin. They must affirm lies or be labeled bigots. They learn to claim victim status rather than develop virtue, to seek grievance rather than excellence.

Relativism's "my truth" creates contradictory claims that leave children without moral compass. "Your truth" says marriage is between man and woman. "My truth" says marriage is any two people who love each other. Both can't be true, but relativism forbids choosing. Children are left confused, unable to build their lives on any foundation, unable to make moral judgments.

All four distort truth (denying objective reality), violate justice (no objective standards), pervert mercy (cannot call to truth/healing if no truth exists), and demand no sacrifice (no cost to hold contradictory views or create own "truth").

**Generational impact:** Society cannot function without shared reality. Children inherit anxiety, confusion, and inability to build civilization on foundation of sand. They cannot form families, build communities, or transmit values because they have no stable truth to stand on.

### Category 5: Counterfeits That Destroy Children's Moral Formation

**No Foundation for Virtue**

| Counterfeit | Distorts Truth | Distorts Justice | Distorts Mercy | Distorts Sacrifice | Result for Children |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Marxism** | Reduces reality to class struggle | Justice becomes vengeance on "oppressors" | No forgiveness for enemies | Misdirects sacrifice toward violent revolution | Taught hatred, division over unity, resentment over solidarity |
| **Scientism** | Only material reality exists | No transcendent basis for dignity | No eternal hope | No purpose beyond biology | No transcendent meaning, nihilism, despair |
| **Atheism** | No God exists | No divine source for morality | No hope for eternal communion | Complete autonomy from transcendent authority | Cannot explain why truth, justice, mercy matter |

**The Generational Impact:**

Four counterfeits destroy children's moral formation by eliminating transcendent foundation for virtue. Adults debate economic systems, government solutions, and empirical evidence while children inherit worldviews that cannot sustain moral life.

Marxism teaches hatred of "oppressors" and misdirects sacrificial impulse toward violent revolution, creating society of resentment rather than solidarity. Children are taught to see the world through class struggle, to hate the wealthy, to seek revenge rather than restoration. The natural impulse to sacrifice for others is channeled toward violence. The result: children who cannot build community, cannot forgive, cannot love across class lines.

Scientism and atheism deny transcendent reality, leaving children with no purpose beyond biology, no foundation for human dignity, no explanation for deepest longings, and no hope for eternal communion. If humans are just matter, why does truth matter? Why should we sacrifice for others? Children raised in scientism and atheism have no answers. They experience moral intuitions but have no foundation for those intuitions. The result: nihilism, despair, inability to explain why truth, justice, and mercy matter.

All four distort truth (reducing reality to matter/power), violate justice (no transcendent basis), pervert mercy (no forgiveness or eternal hope), and either misdirect sacrifice (toward revolution/state) or eliminate it (no transcendent purpose).

**Generational impact:** Nihilism, despair, inability to explain why truth, justice, and mercy matter. Children raised in moral poverty cannot build flourishing lives or society. They have needs they cannot explain, longings they cannot fulfill, intuitions they cannot ground. The result is a generation adrift, unable to find meaning or purpose.

### Category 6: Counterfeits That Destroy Children's Faith Formation

**Incomplete Christianity Cannot Be Transmitted**

| Counterfeit | Distorts Truth | Distorts Justice | Distorts Mercy | Distorts Sacrifice | Result for Children |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **"Faith Alone"** | Separates belief from action | No obligation to act rightly | Cheap grace without conversion | No costly obedience required | Faith doesn't require action, no virtue formation |
| **"Once Saved Always Saved"** | Eternal security regardless of sin | No ongoing moral accountability | Presumption replaces perseverance | No ongoing cost of discipleship | Sin doesn't matter, remain enslaved, salvation meaningless |
| **"Inclusive Christianity"** | All beliefs equally valid | No objective doctrine | Sentimentality replaces truth | No cost to hold contradictory beliefs | Cannot discern truth from error, faith becomes sentiment |
| **"Spiritual not Religious"** | Private spirituality sufficient | No binding to Body of Christ | Isolation replaces ecclesial life | No communal obligations | No Church, sacraments, community—cannot be transmitted |

**The Generational Impact:**

Six Protestant errors systematically destroy children's faith formation by separating essential components of authentic Christianity. Adults debate salvation, authority, and spirituality while children inherit incomplete Christianity that cannot be lived or transmitted.

"Faith Alone" separates belief from action, leaving children with no virtue formation. They're told that faith is enough, that works add nothing. The result: children who believe but don't act, who claim Christ but don't follow Him, who have no formation in justice, mercy, or sacrifice. Faith becomes mere intellectual assent.

"Once Saved Always Saved" presumes eternal security regardless of sin, teaching children sin doesn't matter and leaving them enslaved. They're told that a past decision guarantees heaven regardless of how they live. The result: moral complacency, presumption, and continued slavery to sin. Christ came to free us from sin, but this doctrine tells children they're free while they remain enslaved.

"Inclusive Christianity" makes all beliefs equally valid, leaving children unable to discern truth from error. They're told that all denominations teach truth, that doctrine doesn't matter, that unity means accepting contradictions. The result: children who cannot distinguish Christianity from anything else, who reduce faith to sentiment.

"Spiritual not Religious" rejects institutional Church, leaving children without sacraments, community, or formation that can be transmitted. They're told that personal spirituality is sufficient, that Church is optional. The result: isolated individualism that cannot be passed to the next generation. Faith dies in one generation because there's no community to transmit it, no sacraments to convey grace, no formation to shape virtue.

All six distort truth (separating belief from action, making all beliefs equal, denying Church authority), violate justice (no obligation to act rightly, no binding doctrine), pervert mercy (cheap grace, presumption, sentimentality), and eliminate or distort sacrifice (no costly obedience, no perseverance, no communal obligations).

**Generational impact:** Faith becomes mere sentiment that cannot be lived, children cannot pass on what they never fully received, Christianity reduced to private opinion rather than transformative truth. The result: children who claim Christianity but don't live it, who cannot transmit it to their own children, who watch faith die in their families.

## God's Perfect Love - The Only Foundation for Flourishing Children

There is only one form of love that gives children everything they need to flourish: God's Perfect Love. Here's why.

**The Complete Package: All Six Components Working Together**

1. **Sacred - Children as Image-Bearers:** Every child has infinite dignity from conception. Not commodities, not burdens, not choices—persons made in God's image (Genesis 1:27; Psalm 139:13-16). Result: Children protected, welcomed, valued.

2. **Covenant - Permanent, Binding Promises:** Marriage vows create security for children. "Until death" means children never fear abandonment (Malachi 2:15, Matthew 19:6). Result: Children grow in safety, can be vulnerable, trust relationships.

3. **Truth - Reality as Foundation:** Children taught to see world as it actually is. Bodies, gender, biology, morality grounded in objective reality (John 8:32, Proverbs 22:6). Result: Children confident in navigating life, not confused or anxious.

4. **Justice - Rights and Protection:** Children have right to mother and father. Sacred dignity means protection from exploitation (Psalm 82:3-4, Matthew 18:6). Result: Children secure in their rights, protected from harm.

5. **Mercy - Healing and Restoration:** When parents fail, mercy offers forgiveness and healing. Children learn to extend mercy to others (Lamentations 3:22-23, Luke 15:11-32). Result: Children not trapped by wounds, can be restored.

6. **Sacrifice - Adults Who Put Children First:** Parents willing to give up personal desires for children's good. Community supports families through sacrifice (Philippians 2:3-4, 1 John 3:16). Result: Children prioritized, not abandoned when costly.

**The Generational Blessing: How God's Perfect Love Builds Flourishing Across Generations**

**First Generation:** Children raised in truth, justice, mercy, covenant. Learn authentic love from parents who model it. Formed in virtue through family as domestic church. Result: Healthy, whole persons ready to build their own families.

**Second Generation:** First generation children become parents who know how to love. Pass on authentic love to their children. Build strong families that strengthen community. Result: Virtuous cycle of flourishing families.

**Third Generation and Beyond:** Multiple generations of strong families transform society. Common good built through countless acts of sacrificial love. Culture that protects children, honors families, seeks truth. Result: Civilization of love.

<div class="callout" style="background-color: #073642; padding: 26px 34px; margin: 34px 0; border-radius: 14px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.45; color: #2aa198; border-top: 4px solid #2aa198; border-bottom: 4px solid #2aa198; box-shadow: 0 0 18px rgba(42, 161, 152, 0.12);">
The contrast is stark: Counterfeit love creates generational destruction, compounding wounds, and societal collapse. God's Perfect Love creates generational flourishing, compounding blessings, and societal renewal.

## The Choice Before Us

**The Two Paths:**

**Path 1: Counterfeit Love** - Prioritizes adult autonomy, ideology, personal desires. Ignores children's suffering. Creates generational destruction. Result: Broken children → broken families → broken society → civilization collapse.

**Path 2: God's Perfect Love** - Prioritizes children's needs through sacrificial love. Protects the vulnerable. Creates generational flourishing. Result: Flourishing children → strong families → healthy society → civilization of love.

**The Test:**

The test of any "love" is simple: Does it give children what they need to flourish? Does it protect the most vulnerable? Does it build up the next generation or tear it down?

**The Evidence:**

Many counterfeits, many failures of the test. Only God's Perfect Love passes—because only it has ALL the components children need.

**The Stakes:**

We're not just debating ideas. We're determining whether the next generation will flourish or suffer. Whether our grandchildren will inherit blessing or curse. Whether civilization will be renewed or collapse.

**The Call:**

Choose God's Perfect Love—not because it's easier (it requires sacrifice), not because it's popular (it's countercultural), but because it's the only love that gives children what they need to flourish. Because it's true. Because it works. Because it's what love actually is.

## For the Sake of the Children

Picture two children:

**Child 1:** Raised in counterfeit love—confused about reality, insecure in relationships, wounded by adult choices, inheriting broken worldview, unable to form healthy family.

**Child 2:** Raised in God's Perfect Love—confident in truth, secure in covenant, healed by mercy, formed in virtue, ready to build flourishing family.

Which child do you want for the next generation? The choice is ours. The consequences are theirs.

"I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that you and your descendants may live" (Deuteronomy 30:19).


God's Perfect Love is not just the answer to the problem of evil in theory. It is the answer to the problem of evil in practice—the only foundation that gives children what they need to flourish across generations. For their sake, for the sake of civilization itself, we must choose authentic love over its counterfeits. We must choose life.
