## A Society Torn Apart by Lies

Our society is fracturing before our eyes. Families divided. Churches splitting. The nation polarized. But this isn't just political disagreement or cultural tension. It's something far deeper—a fundamental breakdown of shared reality.

Everyone claims their own "truth." Gender ideology insists that biological sex is a social construct. Abortion advocates call the killing of the unborn "healthcare." Marriage has been redefined to mean whatever we want it to mean. Children, we're told, don't need both a mother and a father. Each group has its own "truth," and anyone who disagrees is labeled hateful, bigoted, or worse.

The problem isn't that we disagree. The problem is that we've abandoned THE Truth—the "whole truth," the "Holy Truth" that alone can bind us together.

As we saw in Chapter 6, Jesus IS Truth incarnate. And it was lies that killed Him. False witnesses testified against Him. Religious leaders accused Him falsely. Pilate knew He was innocent but condemned Him anyway. The crowd chose Barabbas, a murderer, over Jesus, the Truth. Even His own disciples abandoned Him.

Truth Incarnate was murdered by a world built on lies. And those same lies are killing us now—destroying marriages, fracturing families, tearing apart communities, and leaving souls isolated and alone.

We need to return to the origin of love: One, Holy, all-loving God. Only the Whole Truth can heal our fractured society. Only Holy Truth can restore what we were made for—communion with God, with each other, and with our true selves.

This chapter will reveal how participating in God's Perfect Love, rooted in this Holy Truth, is the only way to heal and save our society. Because love isn't just about being nice or feeling good. Love is about communion—life-giving union with God and others that makes us fully alive.

## Life vs. Death: By Their Fruits You Will Know Them

Look at any dimension of life and ask one question: Is it generating life or death?

**Self:**

The person growing in virtue, pursuing truth, integrating body-mind-soul, becoming who God made them to be—that's life-giving.

The person trapped in addiction, self-destruction, fragmentation, refusing to grow, living lies about themselves—that's death-dealing.

**Family:**

The marriage where spouses build each other up, create a home of peace, raise children in love, keep covenant fidelity—that's life-giving.

The "relationship" of mutual exploitation, contraception ensuring no life, broken promises, only bitterness—that's death-dealing.

**Society:**

The community serving the common good, defending the vulnerable, building up others, creating a culture of life—that's life-giving.

The society exploiting the weak, embracing the Culture of Death, promoting radical individualism, treating people as means not ends—that's death-dealing.

**Jesus:**

The Gospel that proclaims truth, administers sacraments through His Church, forms disciples, transforms the world—that's life-giving.

The false gospels that affirm whatever culture says, avoid hard truths, make no demands, produce no fruit—that's death-dealing.

<div class="callout" style="background-color: #073642; padding: 26px 34px; margin: 34px 0; border-radius: 14px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.45; color: #2aa198; border-top: 4px solid #2aa198; border-bottom: 4px solid #2aa198; box-shadow: 0 0 18px rgba(42, 161, 152, 0.12);">
Authentic love is inherently life-giving—it creates, sustains, and multiplies life. Counterfeit love is death-dealing—it consumes, destroys, and ends in sterility. By their fruits you will know them.
</div>

This is the test. Not what people say. Not what they claim. Not their intentions or their feelings. Their fruits. Does this relationship, this choice, this way of life create life or death? Does it build up or tear down? Does it multiply or consume? Does it generate communion or isolation?


## God IS Communion

We've seen throughout this book that the Trinity is the pattern for all love. Nowhere is this more clear than in understanding communion.

The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit exist in perfect communion—three Persons, one God. Not three gods who cooperate. Not one Person with three masks. But three distinct Persons in one divine nature, united in perfect love.

This is *perichoresis*—mutual indwelling. The Father is in the Son, the Son in the Father, the Spirit in both. They're distinct but not separate, united but not confused, one but not solitary.

This is the model for all communion:

**Distinct Persons:** You don't lose yourself in communion. You become more fully yourself. Each Person retains His distinctiveness. True communion doesn't erase identity—it fulfills it.

**Perfect Unity:** Yet they're one—one will, one purpose, one love. Unity without uniformity. The Father, Son, and Spirit are perfectly united while remaining perfectly distinct.

**Mutual Self-Gift:** Each Person gives Himself completely to the others. Their mutual love IS the Holy Spirit—the bond of communion between them.

**Eternal Joy:** This communion is perfect happiness. God created not out of need but out of the overflow of love—love that must give, must create, must multiply.

This is what we're invited into: "That they also may be in us" (John 17:21, NABRE). Not just imitating Trinitarian communion from a distance, but actually participating in it. God invites us into His own life, His own communion, His own joy.

### Made for Communion

"It is not good for the man to be alone" (Genesis 2:18, NABRE). This is God's first "not good" in creation. Everything else is "good" or "very good." But human solitude is "not good."

Why? Because we're made in the image of a God who IS communion. A solitary human doesn't fully image the Trinity. We need relationship, community, communion to be fully human.

But notice: The solution to "not good to be alone" isn't just any company. It's communion—someone who complements, who corresponds, who can enter into true communion. Not just coexistence or connection, but true communion—covenant relationship that creates authentic community.

We were made for this. Our hearts are restless until they rest in communion—with God first, and through Him, with others.


## The True End of Love: Communion, Not Virtue or Self-Fulfillment

Throughout history, Christians have understood love differently—not in its essence, but in its ultimate goal. Where does love lead?

The medieval vision saw love as moral ascent—a ladder toward personal perfection. The knight who loved rightly became more virtuous, more noble, more perfect. This vision elevated love above mere passion, but it contained a subtle danger: one's own virtue could become the goal rather than participation in divine life.

The modern vision sees love as self-fulfillment—personal happiness, emotional satisfaction, self-actualization. "Follow your heart." "Love yourself first." "Do what makes you happy." This is even more self-centered. The modern lover seeks only to feel good. Love becomes psychological therapy, not transformation.

But God's Perfect Love reveals a different vision entirely:

| Vision | Source of Love | Goal of Love | Direction | Character |
|--------|---------------|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Medieval** | Human desire refined by virtue | Moral goodness / becoming noble | Upward (moral ascent) | Love as self-perfection |
| **Modern** | Human emotion and self-expression | Self-fulfillment / happiness | Inward (self-focus) | Love as self-satisfaction |
| **God's Perfect Love** | Divine gift of covenantal grace | Communion with God and others | Outward (self-gift) | Love as life-giving participation |

Our definition corrects both errors: "God's Perfect Love is the sacred gift of covenant which binds truth, justice, mercy, and sacrifice into life-giving **communion**."

Notice the final word: **communion**. Not virtue. Not fulfillment. Communion. This is the true end of love—the goal toward which everything else points.

Truth, justice, mercy, and sacrifice are the framework through which love expresses itself rightly. But they are not the destination. The destination is communion—union with God and others through self-giving love.

Virtue is still essential—truth, justice, mercy, and sacrifice are not optional. But they're no longer the end. They become the structure through which love flows outward to create communion. You don't become good for your own sake; you become good so that divine life can flow through you to others.


## "Be Perfect": What Jesus Really Meant

This is what Jesus meant when He commanded: "Be perfect, just as your heavenly Father is perfect" (Matthew 5:48, NABRE).

Not "sinless" perfection—that's impossible in this life. **WHOLE/COMPLETE perfection**—transformed by God's Love into God's Love, living in the true, just, merciful, and sacrificial communion we were made for.

Perfect = living in full communion with God, neighbor, and true self.

**This is when you're MOST ALIVE:** Every dimension of your being—body, heart, mind, and soul—engaged in love. Not fragmented. Not divided. Not pulled in different directions. Whole. Complete. Integrated. Alive.

**This is why sin hurts:** Every lie, cheat, theft, betrayal DISRUPTS communion. You FEEL the disconnection. The wholeness fragments. The aliveness dies. You're no longer integrated but divided against yourself.

You were made for wholeness, and sin fragments you. You were made for communion, and sin isolates you. You were made for life, and sin brings death.

This is what Jesus prayed for: "That they may all be one, as you, Father, are in me and I in you, that they also may be in us" (John 17:21, NABRE). The goal isn't our individual perfection. The goal is communion—participation in the divine life of the Trinity, which then overflows to create communion with others.

When Jesus commands us to "be perfect," He's not demanding sinless performance. He's inviting us into the wholeness, the completeness, the communion that makes us fully alive. He's calling us to become what we were always meant to be—living images of the God who IS communion.


## When You Know You're Alive: The Birth of a Child

Think about the moment a child is born—especially that sacred instant when the mother first holds her newborn child.

Everything else fades away. The pain, the exhaustion, the fear—all of it disappears. In that moment, there is only communion. Mother and child, united in love, gazing at each other in wonder.

This is **true communion** made visible:

The mother's body has just given life—nine months of total giving of her body, mind, and soul culminating in this moment. Her heart overflows with love she didn't know was possible. Her mind is fully present—nothing else exists. Her soul recognizes the sacred—the eternal breaking into time, the image of God in this tiny face.

The child, held against the mother's heart, experiences the first moment of earthly communion—warmth, safety, love, belonging. The heartbeat that sustained life in the womb now welcomes that life into the world.

And the father, witnessing this sacred communion, enters into it—three distinct persons united in love, creating something entirely new. Mother, father, baby: a "wholly" love-filled communion of persons.

**This is when you know you're ALIVE.** Not just existing. Not just functioning. ALIVE. This is what communion looks like in real life—body, heart, mind, and soul fully integrated in love.

Every other moment of true communion echoes this:

- The marriage vows when you become one flesh
- Holding a dying parent's hand as they pass into eternity
- Deep prayer when you sense God's presence
- **Receiving the Eucharist when Christ becomes one with you**

These are the moments when you're WHOLE. When body, heart, mind, and soul are fully integrated in love. When you're living what Matthew 5:48 means: perfect, complete, holy communion.

**And this is why sin disrupts everything:** When you lie, cheat, steal, betray—you FEEL the communion breaking. The wholeness fragments. The aliveness dies. You're no longer integrated but divided against yourself, or family, or society, or God.


## How Love Creates Life-Giving Communion

Now we can see how love—God's Perfect Love—creates life-giving communion in every dimension of human existence.

### Physical Fruitfulness: Marriage Ordered to Children

The most obvious way love is life-giving is through procreation. Marriage is ordered toward children—not as its only purpose, but as its natural fruit. This is why the Church insists that the unitive and procreative aspects of sexuality cannot be separated. They're two aspects of one reality—love that unites and creates.

Contraception violates this reality by separating what God has joined. It says "I want the pleasure of union but not the responsibility of life." It treats fertility as a disease to be suppressed rather than a gift to be received. It turns the marriage act into mutual use rather than mutual self-gift.

Abortion is even worse—it destroys life already created, the ultimate anti-life act. The child in the womb is not "potential life" but actual life, made in God's image, with infinite dignity and worth. To kill that child is to reject the life-giving nature of love itself.

The Culture of Death our society has embraced—contraception, abortion, euthanasia, assisted suicide—treats life as a problem to be solved rather than a gift to be cherished. It sees children as burdens, the elderly as useless, the disabled as less than human. It's the opposite of communion—it's isolation, consumption, death.

The Church's teaching isn't arbitrary or outdated. It's protecting the truth that love creates life, that sexuality is sacred precisely because it participates in God's creative power, that children are gifts not burdens. Marriage exists for the children—to give them a mother and father united in covenant love, to welcome them into a communion of persons that images the Trinity.

### Spiritual Fruitfulness: All Vocations Called to Bear Fruit

Not everyone is called to physical procreation. Some are called to celibacy—priests, religious, and those who remain single. But everyone is called to spiritual fruitfulness. Priests generate spiritual life through the sacraments. Religious generate life through prayer, service, and witness. Single people generate life through their work, relationships, and service. All Christians are called to make disciples: "Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations" (Matthew 28:19, NABRE).

Jesus says, "I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit that will remain" (John 15:16, NABRE). Not "some of you" or "those called to marriage." All of you. Every Christian is called to be fruitful—to spiritual parenthood, bringing others to faith, forming them in truth, helping them grow in holiness.


### Sacramental: The Eucharist—Where the Definition Becomes REAL

"I am the living bread that came down from heaven; whoever eats this bread will live forever" (John 6:51, NABRE). Christ gives us His own Body and Blood as food. Not symbolically. Not metaphorically. Really, truly, substantially.

When I reverted to Catholicism, I heard the Church teach that the Eucharist is "the source and summit of our faith." I didn't understand it at first. Source and summit? What did that even mean?

I had to dig in. I had to study. I had to let the Church's wisdom teach me what I couldn't see on my own. And it was through digging into this teaching that the Church's Sacred Tradition opened my eyes to see what I had been missing: **the "end" is communion with God**. Which is why our definition of love shows the whole purpose of God's love is "life-giving communion."

The Eucharist IS the source and summit because:

- **SOURCE:** Where we receive God's life (the sacred gift)—communion with God is the starting point
- **SUMMIT:** Where we achieve deepest communion (the goal)—communion with God is the end

It mirrors our definition perfectly: **Sacred** (God's gift) → **Communion** (our participation).

Once I saw that communion with God is both the beginning and the end, everything in Scripture suddenly made sense—from Genesis ("It is not good for the man to be alone") to Revelation ("Behold, God's dwelling is with the human race"). The entire story of salvation is God pursuing communion with us.

And what I discovered was this:

**The Eucharist is WHERE the entire definition becomes REAL in body, heart, mind, and soul:**

**Body:** We physically consume Christ's Body and Blood—not spiritual metaphor but physical reality. Your body receives His Body. Your blood mingles with His Blood. This is the most intimate physical union possible—God entering into you, becoming one with you at the cellular level.

**Heart:** Our love united with His love in the most intimate union possible. Your heart, which so often loves poorly and selfishly, is united with the Sacred Heart that loves perfectly. His love becomes your love. His desires become your desires.

**Mind:** We understand the mystery through faith—"This is my body... this is my blood." Your mind grasps what your senses cannot perceive. You believe what seems impossible. You trust what you cannot see. This is faith—the mind submitting to divine truth.

**Soul:** We're transformed into what we receive—becoming Christ's Body in the world. Your soul, made in God's image, is conformed to Christ's image. You become what you eat. You are transformed into Him. St. Augustine heard Christ say, "I am the food of grown men; grow, and you shall feed upon Me; nor shall you change Me, like the food of your flesh, into yourself, but you shall be changed into Me."

This is love at its most life-giving: The Beloved becomes food for the beloved. The Creator becomes sustenance for the creature. God becomes bread so we can have life.

And this life multiplies: One host can be divided infinitely—every piece is the whole Christ. One Mass can be celebrated everywhere—in cathedrals and prison cells, in hospitals and homes. One Eucharist can feed billions—the bread that never runs out.

**This is the pattern for all love:** Give yourself completely, and life multiplies. Hold back, and life withers.

"Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life within you" (John 6:53, NABRE). Not metaphorical life. Not spiritual life only. **LIFE**—the fullness of communion with God that makes you fully alive.

The Church knew this all along. Sacred Tradition preserved this truth for 2,000 years. I just had to humble myself enough to learn it.


### Ecclesial: Church as Body of Christ

"As a body is one though it has many parts, and all the parts of the body, though many, are one body, so also Christ" (1 Corinthians 12:12, NABRE).

St. Paul's image of the Body of Christ perfectly captures communion:

- Many parts with different gifts, roles, and functions
- One Body united in Christ—not just associated but actually one
- Mutual dependence—"The eye cannot say to the hand, 'I do not need you'" (1 Corinthians 12:21, NABRE)
- Shared suffering and joy—"If one part suffers, all the parts suffer with it; if one part is honored, all the parts share its joy" (1 Corinthians 12:26, NABRE)

This is what the Church is meant to be: Not an institution, not an organization, not a social club. But a communion—the Body of Christ, united to Him and to each other.

When one member suffers, we all suffer. When one member rejoices, we all rejoice. When one member sins, the whole Body is wounded. When one member grows in holiness, the whole Body is strengthened.

This is why the sacraments matter so much. They're not just personal spiritual experiences. They're how we enter into and maintain communion with the Body. Baptism makes us members. Confirmation strengthens us. Eucharist nourishes us. Reconciliation heals us when we've wounded the Body through sin. Marriage and Holy Orders build up the Body in specific ways.

#### The Scandal of Division

Jesus prayed "that they may all be one" (John 17:21, NABRE)—yet our divisions wound His Body.

The devil wants nothing more than denominations and arguments over truth. If there is no truth, he need not worry—chaos serves his purposes.

Every Christian division is a scandal that contradicts the Gospel. Unity doesn't mean uniformity, but it requires submission to truth. The Catholic Church's claim: Christ established ONE Church with authority to preserve truth. Our call: Work for unity (communion) while never compromising truth because love requires truth.

This is painful. Many good, sincere Christians are separated from full communion with the Catholic Church. Many have been hurt by Catholics. Many have legitimate questions about Catholic teaching. But the scandal remains: Christ prayed for unity, and we are divided. The path forward is humbly seeking the truth together—because truth is sacred, it comes from God—trusting that Christ will lead us to the unity He prayed for, working for communion while never compromising the truth that makes communion possible.

### Eternal: Covenant Communion of Saints

One of the most beautiful aspects of Catholic teaching is the communion of saints—the reality that we are united with all believers across time and space:

- **Church Triumphant** (saints in heaven) pray for us, intercede for us, cheer us on
- **Church Suffering** (souls in purgatory) are being purified—we can help them through our prayers and sacrifices
- **Church Militant** (us on earth) are fighting the good fight, united with each other and with all the saints

This means you're never alone. You're part of a covenant communion or Body of Christ that spans heaven and earth, past and present, time and eternity.

When you pray, you pray with all the saints. When you suffer, you suffer with Christ and all who have suffered before you. When you rejoice, you rejoice with the whole communion of saints. When you receive the Eucharist, you're united not just with Christ but with every believer who has ever received Him.

All of this points to the ultimate goal: the Beatific Vision—seeing God face to face in perfect communion. "Now we see indistinctly, as in a mirror, but then face to face. At present I know partially; then I shall know fully, as I am fully known" (1 Corinthians 13:12, NABRE).

This is what we're made for. This is where love leads. This is the end—perfect, complete, eternal communion with God and all the saints. Not losing ourselves but finding ourselves. Not being absorbed into God but being fully united to Him while remaining fully ourselves. Perfect communion. Perfect love. Perfect life.


## Call to Sainthood: FOR THE CHILDREN

What is a saint? A saint is someone who submits their whole life—body, mind, and soul—to living God's Perfect Love. They integrate truth, justice, mercy, and sacrifice in every dimension of their existence, allowing Christ to transform them into living witnesses of authentic love.

Saints aren't people who never struggle or sin. They're people who keep getting back up, who keep submitting to God's transforming grace, who keep choosing love even when it costs them everything. They're ordinary people who allow God to do extraordinary things through them.

This call to sainthood isn't reserved for a spiritual elite. It's the universal Christian vocation. Every baptized person is called to become a saint—to live the complete, integrated love we've explored in these ten chapters.

### FOR THE LOVE OF CHILDREN

Everyone loves children intuitively—we're made to protect and nurture them. This is your heart's deepest instinct.

**The children are watching.** They're watching YOU.

Will they see authentic communion or counterfeit connection? Will they see parents ALIVE in God's love or just going through motions? Will they see marriage as life-giving covenant or disposable contract? Will they see the Church as Body of Christ or social club?

Children need to SEE life-giving communion lived out:

- They need parents who are WHOLE—body, heart, mind, soul integrated in love
- They need to witness sacrifice that creates life, not selfishness that destroys it
- They need to see truth honored, justice practiced, mercy given
- They need to experience what it means to be ALIVE in God's love

**Your first path to sainthood: Having, raising, and teaching children.**

Marriage exists FOR the children—to give them mother and father united in covenant love. Not just biological parents, but a communion of persons that images the Trinity. Children need to see what covenant looks like. They need to witness sacrifice. They need to experience authentic communion.

For those called to celibacy—priests, religious, single people—there's spiritual parenthood through mentoring, teaching, serving. Every Christian is called to make disciples, to form the next generation, to bring others to faith.

**This is urgent:**

Children are being fed lies about love, identity, purpose, truth. They're being told there's no objective reality, no sacred truth, no holy communion. They're being raised in the Culture of Death that treats life as problem. They're being robbed of the wholeness they were made for.

They're being told that gender is a choice, that marriage is whatever you want it to be, that children don't need mothers and fathers, that life in the womb isn't really life, that the elderly and disabled are burdens, that truth is whatever you feel it to be.

They're being lied to. And these lies are killing them—spiritually, emotionally, sometimes even physically.

**They need YOU to be a saint who lives in life-giving communion.**

Not perfect. Not sinless. But WHOLE. Alive. Integrated. Real.

They need you to show them what it looks like when someone submits their whole life to God's Perfect Love—when truth, justice, mercy, and sacrifice bind together into life-giving communion.

They need to see that communion with God is possible. That wholeness is real. That love isn't just a feeling but a way of life. That sacrifice leads to life. That truth sets you free. That justice and mercy work together. That the Eucharist is the source and summit. That the Church is the Body of Christ. That sainthood is the universal call.

The world desperately needs saints. The next generation needs saints. Your family needs you to be a saint. Your children—biological or spiritual—need you to be a saint.

And here's the beautiful truth: The perfect love of the Holy Trinity is the sacramental grace that transforms us into saints. The Church teaches us how to live this love. The sacraments provide the power. The communion of saints provides the support. Everything you need to become a saint united to Christ and His Church has been given to you.

**The only question is: Will you submit your whole life to living God's Perfect Love?**

**The next generation is depending on us. Let's not fail them.**


## The Journey Continues

We've now unpacked the complete definition: God's Perfect Love is the sacred gift of covenant which binds truth, justice, mercy, and sacrifice into life-giving communion.

- **Truth** (Ch 6): The foundation—objective reality, Jesus IS truth
- **Justice** (Ch 7): Giving what is due according to truth
- **Mercy** (Ch 8): Transcending justice without violating it
- **Sacrifice** (Ch 9): Love made visible through action
- **Life-Giving Communion** (Ch 10): The goal where all facets unite

Each facet is essential. Remove any one, and love becomes something less than love. Together, they form the complete answer to the problem of evil we identified in Chapter 1.

But understanding the definition is just the beginning. Now we need to see how this love has been revealed, how it's made accessible, how it transforms us, and how it calls all Christians to unity.

This is where Part 2 begins—applying this definition to key Christian questions and showing how it unlocks the deepest truths of our faith.

The lies that are tearing our society apart can only be defeated by the Holy Truth of God's Perfect Love. The isolation and loneliness that plague our world can only be healed by life-giving communion. The Culture of Death can only be overcome by love that creates, sustains, and multiplies life.

And it starts with you. With your choice. With your submission to God's Perfect Love. With your willingness to become a saint—not someday, not when you're ready, but now.

The children are watching. The world is waiting. The Church needs you. Christ is calling.

Will you answer?

## Living the Response

**Three Questions to Ask:**

1. **Where am I experiencing true communion in my life?** (With God? With family? With the Church?) Where am I settling for mere connection instead of covenant communion?

2. **What lies am I believing that fragment my wholeness?** What keeps me from being fully integrated—body, heart, mind, and soul—in love?

3. **How am I being called to spiritual parenthood?** Whether through biological children, spiritual children, or making disciples—how is God calling me to bear fruit that remains?

**Practical Steps:**

- **Daily Eucharist (if possible):** Make the source and summit of your faith the center of your daily life. If daily Mass isn't possible, make a spiritual communion.

- **Examine Communion:** Each night, ask: "Where did I experience true communion today? Where did I settle for less? Where did sin disrupt communion?"

- **For the Children:** If you have children, ask daily: "What did my children see in me today? Did they see authentic communion or counterfeit connection?" If you don't have biological children, ask: "How am I being spiritually fruitful? Who am I bringing to faith?"

- **Study the Eucharist:** Read John 6 slowly. Study the Church's teaching on the Real Presence. Let the Church's Sacred Tradition open your eyes to what you might be missing.

- **Pursue Unity:** Pray for Christian unity. Work for communion while never compromising truth. If you're not Catholic, seriously investigate the Church's claims. If you are Catholic, learn why the Church teaches what she teaches.

**Prayer:**

*Lord Jesus Christ, You who are the living bread come down from heaven, open my eyes to see what communion truly means. Help me understand that You didn't just teach about love—You ARE love incarnate, inviting me into the very life of the Trinity.*

*Forgive me for settling for connection when You offer communion. Forgive me for believing the lies that fragment my wholeness. Forgive me for living as if I'm alone when You've surrounded me with the communion of saints.*

*Transform me into what I receive in the Eucharist. Make me a living witness of Your Perfect Love—truth, justice, mercy, and sacrifice bound together in life-giving communion.*

*For the children who are watching, for the world that is waiting, for the Church that needs saints—make me a saint. Not someday. Now.*

*I submit my whole life—body, heart, mind, and soul—to living Your Perfect Love. May Your communion become my communion. May Your life become my life. May Your love become my love.*

*Amen.*
