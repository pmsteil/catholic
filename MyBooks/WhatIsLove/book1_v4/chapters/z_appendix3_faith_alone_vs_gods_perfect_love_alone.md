### Why This Letter Matters: A Personal Note

For years now, I have listened to debates between Catholics and Protestants about "faith alone" versus "faith and works." I watched intelligent, devoted Christians argue past each other about what's required for salvation, each side armed with Scripture verses, each convinced the other was dangerously wrong.

But something was missing from these debates—something so obvious once you see it that you wonder how everyone missed it: **Love**.

Most discussions about justification, sanctification, faith, works, and grace barely mention love at all. They treat salvation like a legal transaction or a mechanical process. But how can we understand what Jesus came to save us from—or what true salvation even is—without understanding the very nature of God, who IS Love?

It was in thinking deeply about *sola fide*, wrestling with what faith really means, what works really are, how grace actually operates, that I was forced to go deeper. And in going deeper, I discovered that the answer to the faith-versus-works debate isn't found in choosing one side or the other, but in recognizing that both faith and works find their meaning, their power, and their purpose in Love—God's Perfect Love that integrates truth, justice, mercy, sacrifice, and covenant into one divine reality.

This discovery didn't just resolve a theological puzzle for me. It revolutionized my understanding of the Gospel itself. I came to see that every theological controversy, every moral teaching, every sacramental practice of the Church is ultimately about one thing: helping us receive and live God's Perfect Love.

So while this letter appears at the end of the book, it represents the beginning of my journey. The questions it addresses drove me to write everything that came before—to show my all my brothers and sisters in Christ that when we truly understand what Love is, the supposed contradictions between faith and works, grace and effort, divine sovereignty and human freedom all resolve into a beautiful, integrated whole.

To my dear brothers and sisters in Christ—especially those who confess that we are justified by faith alone—receive this as a humble offering of gratitude and hope. We all look to the same crucified and risen Lord. We all rely upon the same grace. We all long for the same communion with the Father in the Spirit. If I argue for God's Perfect Love as the deepest truth of the gospel, I do so not to erase "faith alone," but to fulfill what "faith alone" most truly desires: to be bound to Jesus by the very Love that is God.

### The Question in Good Faith

“Faith alone” insists—beautifully—that salvation is God’s work, not our boast. It is a protest against fear, performance, and spiritual bookkeeping. It magnifies Christ, exalts the sufficiency of His cross, and protects the conscience: “Whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16).

God's Perfect Love insists that the same God who justifies by grace also indwells, heals, and transforms by grace, such that the end for which we are made is not merely acquittal, but communion: to "abide" in Christ and bear fruit (John 15), to become what we behold (2 Corinthians 3:18). It is not Love versus faith; it is Love embracing faith and bringing it to its fullness.

### What "Faith Alone" Seeks to Safeguard

- The primacy of grace: We do not climb to God. God descends to us (Ephesians 2:8–9).
- The sufficiency of Christ: His obedience, not ours, is our righteousness (Romans 5:19).
- The relief of conscience: Trust anchors us in God’s mercy, not in our fluctuating merits.

These are treasures every Christian should cherish. A humble Catholic heart can say “amen.”

### What God's Perfect Love Seeks to Reveal

Scripture teaches that God is Love (1 John 4:8). Love is not merely a divine feeling; it is God’s very Being poured out in the Son and the Spirit. Because Love is first, Love is also last: “Love never ends” (1 Corinthians 13:8). And because Love is first and last, Love is also the form—the living shape—of the believer’s life now: “faith working through love” (Galatians 5:6).

To say God's Perfect Love is to confess that:

- The source of salvation is Love: “God so loved the world…” (John 3:16).
- The way of salvation is Love: “Abide in my love… keep my commandments” (John 15:9–10).
- The end of salvation is Love: "And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love" (1 Corinthians 13:13).

Love is thus not a rival principle beside faith, but the divine life into which faith introduces us. Faith is the open hand that receives Christ; Love is Christ’s own life poured into the heart by the Spirit (Romans 5:5).

### The Biblical Pattern: One Grace, Three Theological Virtues

Scripture and the great Christian tradition speak of faith, hope, and love together (1 Corinthians 13:13). They are not competing ladders but a single grace unfolding:

- Faith receives Christ.
- Hope anchors us in God’s promises.
- Love unites us to God and neighbor in Christ.

James warns against a “faith” without love: “Faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead” (James 2:17). Paul warns against “works” without love: “If I give away all I have…but have not love, I gain nothing” (1 Corinthians 13:3). The apostles are not contradicting each other; they are guarding a single mystery from opposite cliffs. The heartbeat of the New Testament is that the faith that justifies is the faith that loves, because the Justifier Himself indwells the believer and loves in and through them (Galatians 2:20).

### Clarifying "Works": Not Wages, but Communion

When the New Testament rejects “works,” it rejects the idea that God’s favor can be earned by human effort. But when it commands works of love, it calls us to participate in Christ’s own life. These “works” are not wages; they are wedding-life—signs that the Vine is alive in the branches (John 15:1–8). If Love is in us, Love acts. If Love acts in us, all the glory goes to God.

Thus, to say God's Perfect Love is to confess that any true good we do is God's Love moving us. Our cooperation is real, but Love is anterior, empowering, and triumphant. “It is God who works in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure” (Philippians 2:13).

### Mercy's Logic: Justification and Sanctification as One Embrace

Viewed within Love, justification and sanctification are not rival operations but two notes of the same music: God declares the sinner righteous in Christ and simultaneously begins to make the sinner righteous by Christ. The declaration heals; the healing declares. Christ is our righteousness (1 Corinthians 1:30), and the Spirit conforms us to Him (Romans 8:29). The emphasis may differ among Christians, but the melody is one: the redeemed become like the Redeemer because His Love is not only for us but in us.

### Why Language Matters—and Why Love Is Larger

Many will say: “Faith alone justifies, but the faith that justifies is never alone.” Catholics clarify: “We are justified by grace through faith, and this faith is enlivened and formed by love” (Galatians 5:6). Both mean to deny Pelagianism, both mean to confess grace, both mean to exalt Christ.

So why speak of God's Perfect Love? Because Scripture itself places Love as both origin and goal, form and fulfillment. Faith is indispensable—as sight is indispensable to a journey. But the destination is Love: God Himself, and union with Him. Faith is ordered to Love as seed to fruit, promise to fulfillment, engagement to marriage supper (Revelation 19:7–9). Every gift of God’s grace is, from first to last, the self-gift of the God who is Love.

### Practical Convergence: One Life, One Witness

- In prayer: Faith trusts; Love abides. We come boldly to the throne of grace (Hebrews 4:16) and linger there because Love welcomes us.
- In moral life: Faith hears; Love obeys. “If you love me, you will keep my commandments” (John 14:15). Obedience is not a fee; it is fidelity in friendship (John 15:14–15).
- In suffering: Faith clings; Love endures. “The love of Christ controls us” (2 Corinthians 5:14), and so we endure trials, knowing that nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:39).
- In mission: Faith proclaims; Love persuades. We preach Christ crucified, and we become, by grace, living parables of His mercy (Matthew 5:14–16).

### How Then Shall We Inherit Eternal Life?

Jesus Himself answered this question with perfect clarity. When a lawyer tested Him, asking "Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" Jesus responded:

"What is written in the Law? How do you read it?" And he answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself." And Jesus said to him, "You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live" (Luke 10:25-28).

There it is—the path to complete union with our Lord: Love. Not faith without love. Not works without love. Not sacraments without love. But Perfect Love that encompasses all these things—loving the Lord our God with all the truth, justice, and mercy due Him, and loving our neighbor with that same divine love.

But notice—Jesus doesn't say "do this and you will go to heaven when you die." He says "do this and you will LIVE." Present tense. Now. Today.

This is why understanding Perfect Love matters so deeply. It's not merely about winning theological debates or even just about "getting to heaven" someday—it's about being truly saved RIGHT NOW from the ramifications of not loving God with our whole heart. Jesus came that we might have life "and have it abundantly" (John 10:10). He taught us to pray "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven" (Matthew 6:10)—not "get us out of earth and into heaven."

All of Christ's teachings were about how to love deeply HERE, how to live in communion NOW, how to experience the Kingdom of God that is already "in your midst" (Luke 17:21). When we choose sin instead of love, we don't just risk our eternal destiny—we experience hell on earth: broken relationships, addiction, despair, violence, loneliness, meaninglessness. Look around at our society drowning in these consequences.

The Gospel isn't just fire insurance for the afterlife. It's rescue from the death we're already experiencing when we fail to love.

### An Urgent Call for Unity: The Scandal of Division

If you confess "faith alone," keep confessing it with the breadth Scripture gives it: a living faith that works through love because Love Himself has taken up residence in your heart. And if you confess God's Perfect Love, remember that Love Himself has ordained faith as Love's doorway, hope as Love's anchor, the sacraments as Love's touch, and the Church as Love's household.

But here I must speak plainly about what weighs heaviest on my heart: Our divisions are causing scandal in the world.

When Christians teach contradictory things about salvation, about morality, about the very nature of God's love, we confuse those seeking truth. This contradiction cannot be from God, for God is the source of all Truth—there must be ONE Truth. Our teenagers are lost, searching for identity in LGBTQIA+ ideologies, in hormone therapies, in social media extremism. Our society drowns in drug abuse, prostitution, sex slavery, one-night stands, abortions, adultery, and divorce. Children suffer in the wake of broken families—sometimes multiple divorces.

They look to Christians for answers and find us arguing among ourselves.

This is why I make this appeal: Let us return to the Church that Jesus divinely established when He, with all His authority, commanded His apostles: "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you" (Matthew 28:19-20).

He is the Author of the Church. We must submit to His authority IN His Church—not because the Catholic Church needs to grow, but because our world desperately needs to see Christians who are saints. Not perfect, but putting their complete faith in Him for His love and then LIVING that truth.

Love is sacrifice. Let us sacrifice our divisions for His one true love—for all those lost souls who need to see Christ in us.

Imagine if all Christians stood united in proclaiming and living God's Perfect Love—truth with justice with mercy. Imagine if our nation became truly Christian, the most virtuous nation in existence, a beacon of hope in a world drowning in immorality. This isn't about denominational pride. It's about souls perishing while we debate.

Let us, then, not stand in rival camps shouting slogans across a valley Christ has bridged with His own Body. Instead, let us stand together under the Cross, where Love shows us what Love means: "Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:13). From that Cross, He gives us His Spirit, who pours God's love into our hearts (Romans 5:5), so that the world might know we are His disciples—by our love (John 13:35).

The world is watching. The lost are dying. Our children are suffering.

It's time to lay down our apologetical arms and take up the arms of His Perfect Love.

### Final Word

Faith magnifies Christ by trusting Him. Love magnifies Christ by becoming like Him. The gospel magnifies Christ by uniting us to Him. If we must choose a single banner to fly over all, let it be the one Scripture flies: “the greatest of these is love” (1 Corinthians 13:13). Not because faith is small, but because faith’s greatness is to hand us over to Love, and Love’s greatness is to hand us over to God.

May the God who is Love perfect our faith, sustain our hope, and crown us with Himself.

## A Benediction for the Battle

May the God who IS Perfect Love—who integrates truth, justice, mercy, sacrifice, and covenant into one divine reality—unite us all in His Kingdom for the good fight that lies before us.

May we who have argued about faith and works finally see that both flow from the same source: His Perfect Love poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit.

May we who have divided over doctrine unite in living the Gospel that saves not just souls for eternity, but lives from the hell they're experiencing today.

May we take up the armor of God—not against each other, but against the real enemy who delights in our divisions while souls perish for lack of love.

May we become the saints our broken world desperately needs to see—not perfect, but perfectly surrendered to Perfect Love.

May our children see in us what authentic love looks like, so they need not search for identity in the world's counterfeits.

May our marriages reflect the covenant love of Christ and His Church, becoming beacons of hope in a culture of disposable relationships.

May our parishes become hospitals for sinners rather than museums for saints, where the wounded find healing in Perfect Love.

May our nation—through our united witness—become that city on a hill, showing the world what happens when a people choose to love the Lord their God with all their heart, soul, strength, and mind, and their neighbors as themselves.

And when we stand before the throne of Perfect Love at the end of our days, may we hear not "you had perfect theology" but "Well done, good and faithful servant—you loved as I loved you."

The battle is real. The stakes are eternal. The world is hungry for His Perfect Love.

Let us fight the good fight together, united in His Perfect Love.

In the name of the Father who is Love,
And of the Son who revealed Love,
And of the Holy Spirit who pours Love into our hearts,
Amen.

—Your fellow soldier in the Kingdom fighting for God's Perfect Love
