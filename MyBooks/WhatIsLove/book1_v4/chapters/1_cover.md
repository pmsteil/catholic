# What is Love?

God's Perfect Love is the sacred gift of covenant which binds truth, justice, mercy and sacrifice into life-giving communion.

This book is dedicated to you who, like me I suspect, desires to love God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind.
