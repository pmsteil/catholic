## The Universal Cry

"That's not fair!"

Every child knows it. Every human heart feels it. The instinctive recognition that some things are objectively wrong—not just unpleasant or inconvenient, but actually, truly unjust.

The bully taking the smaller child's lunch money. The boss taking credit for his employee's work. The judge accepting bribes to favor the wealthy. The strong exploiting the weak. The powerful oppressing the vulnerable.

We all know—immediately, instinctively, universally—that these things are wrong. Not just socially disapproved. Not just culturally relative. Wrong.

This universal cry for justice reveals something profound: Justice is written on every human heart. It's part of the natural law, the moral order built into creation itself. We recognize it because we're made in the image of a God who IS just.

But here's a critical question: **How can we recognize injustice unless there's a transcendent standard of justice we're comparing it to?**

Think about it logically:

When you say "That's not fair!" you're appealing to some higher standard of fairness. You're saying this situation falls short of how things *should* be. But where does that "should" come from?

**Stop and think about this carefully—it's crucial:**

Every time you claim something is unjust, you're measuring it against a standard. You're saying "This violates how things ought to be." But if there's no objective "ought"—if justice is just whatever humans make up—then your claim of injustice is meaningless. It's just your opinion. And someone else's opposite opinion has exactly the same authority: none.

Consider what happens when people detach justice from God: They claim "It's unjust to deny women abortion rights"—calling the killing of innocent children "justice." They claim "It's unjust to exclude men from women's sports"—calling the erasure of biological reality "justice." They claim "It's unjust to force someone to suffer"—calling assisted suicide "justice." They claim "It's unjust to require children to have both a mother and father"—calling the deliberate deprivation of parents "justice."

**Here's what we all need to understand:** If there's no transcendent, objective standard of justice—if justice is just a human invention or cultural preference—then **none of these claims mean anything**. Not yours. Not theirs. Not anyone's.

Without an objective, true moral standard that comes from the Author of the universe, there is no "should." There is no "ought." There is no "right" or "wrong." There is only power—whoever is strongest gets to impose their preferences on everyone else. Your passionate cry for justice? It's just noise. Your moral outrage? It's just a feeling with no more authority than someone's preference for chocolate over vanilla. And neither statement has any more moral value than the other. It's just preference. Just opinion. Just feeling.

**You literally have no ground to stand on when you fight for "justice."** You're making an appeal to a standard that—if you're right that there's no God—doesn't exist. You're borrowing from a worldview you reject to make arguments you can't justify.

Think about what this means practically:

When you say "Child abuse is wrong," what you really mean—if there's no God—is "I don't like child abuse." And when someone else says "Child abuse is fine," they mean "I'm okay with child abuse." And neither statement has any moral value over the other.

**But we all know—deep down—that some things are objectively unjust.** Not just "I don't like this" but "This is actually, truly wrong." Child abuse is wrong even if a society approves it. Slavery is wrong even if it's legal. Genocide is wrong even if the majority supports it. These aren't opinions. They're facts about reality.

And the moment you recognize that—the moment you insist that some things are objectively unjust regardless of what anyone thinks—you are appealing to an objective standard of justice. A transcendent measure against which all human actions can be judged.

And that standard cannot be human opinion (because humans disagree). It cannot be cultural convention (because cultures differ). It cannot be evolutionary advantage (because evolution cannot explain the transcendent source of the moral feelings themselves—the chemical reactions in our bodies that produce feelings of despair or resentment when we experience injustice have no ability to explain why those chemicals flow in the first place). It cannot be majority vote (because majorities can be wrong). It cannot be personal feeling (because feelings conflict).

**The standard must be eternal, unchanging, and absolute. It must transcend all human systems and preferences. In other words, it must be God Himself.**

This isn't just philosophy. This is the foundation of every fight for justice you've ever cared about. Every time you've said "That's not fair," you've been appealing to God's standard—whether you knew it or not. Every time you've demanded justice, you've been proving that God exists—because without Him, justice is just a word with no meaning.

This is why human attempts to author justice without God inevitably fail—they reject the only possible source of objective justice and replace it with human preference that serves self-interest. As we explored in Chapter 4, when morality is authored by humans rather than received from divine authority, it must be imposed through force because it has no inherent authority.

True justice requires a source beyond ourselves: the God who IS justice itself. Without God, the cry "That's not fair!" has no more authority than "I don't like broccoli." With God, it becomes a recognition of objective reality—a violation of the moral order built into creation by its Creator.

Justice is love giving each person what they are due based on their dignity as image-bearers of God. Without justice, love becomes arbitrary sentiment. With justice, love has objective content and concrete expression.

## What Justice Actually Means

Our culture has confused justice with revenge, fairness with equality, rights with desires. We need to recover the true meaning.

The Hebrew Scriptures use two main words for justice: *Mishpat* (right judgment, vindication of the oppressed) and *Tsedeqah* (righteousness, right relationships). Together, they reveal justice as both giving what's due and restoring what's broken.

Modern "justice" often means punishment or revenge, enforcing equality of outcomes, or asserting rights without responsibilities. Biblical justice means giving each person what they're truly owed based on their true dignity—and working to restore right relationships when they're broken.

## Justice Grounded in Imago Dei

Why does every person deserve justice? Because they're made in God's image: "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them" (Genesis 1:27).

This is the foundation of all human rights and all justice: Because every human being is made in the image and likeness of God, and because love is something we do for the good of the other, being a human being carries duties and responsibilities toward each other—to tell the truth, to treat each other justly, to forgive for the good of the relationship and covenant.

If we all have these moral duties, then another way to describe this is that each of us has the right to be treated with truth, justice, and mercy in terms of our life and our freedom to do good to our neighbor. But we never have the right to carry out an act that is false, unjust, or unmerciful toward our neighbor. We may have the free will to do this, but not the "right".

In other words, we cannot possibly understand how we are "endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights" (for American readers) unless we first understand that rights flow from our duty to treat each man, woman, and child with truth, justice, and mercy—the way we were designed by God, and the way we expect to be treated by others.

Justice means honoring this reality. Injustice means denying it—treating people as less than human, violating their dignity, refusing what's owed to them.

And here's something crucial we often miss: **We're not souls using bodies as tools—we're embodied persons.** Pope Saint John Paul II taught that "the body, and it alone, is capable of making visible what is invisible: the spiritual and the divine." This means justice must honor not just the soul but the body's dignity and truth.

Think about what this means practically: When our culture denies biological sex and insists men can become women, it's not just wrong—it's unjust to the body itself. When we separate sexuality from procreation through contraception, we violate the body's language of self-gift. When we treat bodies as commodities through pornography, prostitution, or surrogacy, we commit injustice against the person the body reveals.

To dishonor the body is to dishonor the person. To lie about what the body reveals is to commit injustice against reality itself. True justice recognizes that our bodies matter—they're not accidents of biology but essential to who we are as image-bearers of God.

## How Justice Serves Love

Justice isn't opposed to love—it's love's foundation. Justice provides objective standards that ground love in reality. Justice protects the vulnerable by giving love the power to say "This is wrong" objectively. Justice creates the stability that allows love to endure. Justice enables the trust that makes relationship possible. Justice prepares for mercy—you can only transcend justice with mercy if there's justice to transcend.

### How Justice Forms the Soul

**When we practice justice—giving God His due in worship, giving our neighbor their due in respect—we're forming our souls to recognize and honor the dignity in every being.** This isn't cold legalism. This is training our hearts to see as God sees, to value what God values, to love as God loves.

A soul formed in justice develops wisdom—the ability to treat others correctly according to their true dignity. This wisdom enables deep, authentic connection. When you truly see another person's worth and honor their dignity as an image-bearer of God, your soul can connect with their soul in a profound way.

When you practice justice toward someone—acknowledging their worth, giving them what they're due—you're creating the conditions for real relationship. Your soul is learning to recognize the sacred in others, to respond appropriately to their inherent worth.

This is what it means to be part of a covenant people—souls bound together by shared recognition of truth and mutual commitment to justice. We're members of a Body where each person's dignity matters, where justice creates the framework for mercy to flourish, where our souls are interconnected through mutual respect and honor.

When we fail in justice—when we exploit, oppress, or dehumanize—we damage our own souls, severing the bonds that connect us to others. But when we practice justice faithfully, our souls become capable of the deep, authentic love that honors each person's true worth.

## Justice vs. Partiality: The Truth About "Inclusion"

Our culture claims to champion "inclusion," "diversity," and "equity" (DEI). But here's what we need to understand: **Modern "inclusion" is actually partiality—the very opposite of justice.**

Justice treats each person according to their inherent dignity as image-bearers of God, regardless of race, class, sex, or any other external characteristic. Partiality treats people according to their group identity—showing favoritism to some while discriminating against others based on tribe, politics, or ideology.

Scripture explicitly condemns partiality: "My brethren, show no partiality as you hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory" (James 2:1). Why? Because partiality violates the fundamental truth that all humans share equal dignity before God.

**Here's the deception:** Modern "inclusion" doesn't actually include everyone. It includes only certain favored groups while actively excluding others. Identity politics doesn't treat all identities equally—it creates hierarchies of victimhood and privilege. DEI initiatives don't pursue equal dignity—they pursue equal outcomes by showing partiality based on immutable characteristics.

Consider what this looks like in practice:
- "Inclusion" that excludes Christians who hold biblical views on marriage and sexuality
- "Diversity" that demands uniformity of thought on political issues
- "Equity" that discriminates against some races to favor others
- "Anti-racism" that judges people by skin color rather than character
- "Social justice" that divides humanity into oppressor and oppressed classes
- "Income equality" that shows partiality based on wealth rather than addressing actual injustice

This is partiality masquerading as justice. It creates "us vs. them" tribalism rather than recognizing our common humanity. It shows favoritism based on external factors rather than inherent dignity. It violates the very justice it claims to pursue.

**True justice is impartial.** It gives each person what they're due based on their nature as image-bearers of God—not based on their race, sex, class, politics, or any other immutable external characteristic. Justice doesn't play favorites. Justice doesn't create hierarchies of victimhood. Justice treats the homeless man and the CEO, the immigrant and the citizen, the conservative and the progressive with equal dignity because all bear God's image.

Partiality feels like compassion but is actually a form of contempt—treating people as defined by their group identity rather than their individual dignity, as too fragile to be held to objective standards, as victims who need special treatment rather than persons capable of truth and virtue.

True love REQUIRES justice—impartial justice that treats all people as capable of truth, worthy of standards, able to grow and change, regardless of their group identity.

## Justice in Different Relationships

Justice takes different forms depending on the relationship:

**Justice Toward God:** Worship, obedience, gratitude. We owe God everything—our existence, our gifts, our salvation. Justice means acknowledging this and responding appropriately.

**Justice Toward Parents:** Honor, care, respect. They gave us life and raised us. Justice means honoring that debt, caring for them in their need.

**Justice Toward Spouse:** Fidelity, self-gift, partnership. We made covenant vows. Justice means keeping them—not just when it's easy, but always.

**Justice Toward Children:** Protection, formation, provision. They're entrusted to our care. Justice means giving them what they need to flourish—physically, emotionally, spiritually.

**Justice Toward Neighbors:** Respect, honesty, fairness. They share our common humanity. Justice means treating them as we'd want to be treated.

**Justice Toward Enemies:** Even enemies deserve basic human dignity. Justice means not dehumanizing them, not seeking revenge, not violating their fundamental rights.

## How Justice Combats Evil

Justice combats exploitation by protecting the vulnerable and defending the oppressed. Justice combats systemic oppression—racism, economic exploitation, political corruption—by exposing violations of human dignity. Justice combats relativism by recognizing objective standards based on human dignity. Justice combats enabling by holding people accountable because they're capable of better. Justice combats revenge by seeking to restore rather than harm.

## Justice and the Common Good

Justice isn't just individual—it's social. The common good means the conditions that allow all people to flourish—peace, order, opportunity, protection of rights, promotion of virtue.

Justice toward the common good requires subsidiarity (solving problems at the most local level), solidarity (the strong helping the weak), respect for human dignity in every policy and law, family priority (protecting the fundamental unit of society—because the unity of the family in truth, justice, and mercy is the first and most important teacher of this love), and religious freedom (the right to worship according to conscience). The common good allows all people to live in true covenantal communion.

## The Sacrament of Reconciliation: Justice and Mercy United in Truth

The Catholic Sacrament of Reconciliation perfectly demonstrates how justice and mercy work together. Justice requires acknowledging sin (confession), accepting consequences (penance), making amends (restitution). Mercy offers forgiveness (absolution), restoration (grace), healing (reconciliation).

The sacrament doesn't choose between justice and mercy—it integrates both. Notice how the structure honors both, grounded in truth about human nature:

We must face the truth about our sins (examination). We must speak our sins aloud—truth reveals that we NEED to confess, to bring sin into the light. We must genuinely repent—recognizing we've violated something sacred. We must accept consequences and make amends—when we commit grave sins, we feel a deep need to "make up" for what we've done. Simply being told "you're forgiven" might not be enough—we feel the need to DO something to make amends. The sacrament honors this truth about how we're made. God offers complete forgiveness—mercy transcending what justice requires. We commit to change—justice and mercy together leading to transformation.

This is love in action—truth about sin, justice requiring acknowledgment, mercy offering forgiveness, all working together to heal and restore. The sacrament shows us that authentic love never chooses between truth, justice, and mercy; it holds them in perfect tension, each making the others more powerful.

## Do You Want True Justice?

If you've read this far, you've felt it—that deep hunger for justice. You know in your bones that some things are wrong and must be made right. You've cried out "That's not fair!" and meant it with every fiber of your being.

But here's the question: **Do you want human justice or God's justice?**

Human justice is always incomplete. It's tainted by self-interest, limited by ignorance, corrupted by power, and ultimately imposed by force. Even at its best, human justice can only punish wrongdoing—it cannot heal the wound, restore what was broken, or transform the wrongdoer.

**God's justice is different.** It's perfect because it flows from perfect love. It's complete because it integrates truth, mercy, and sacrifice. It's powerful because it doesn't just punish—it restores, heals, and transforms.

God's justice says: "Yes, this was wrong. Yes, there are consequences. Yes, restitution must be made." But it doesn't stop there. God's justice opens the door to mercy. It makes room for repentance. It offers the possibility of redemption. It transforms enemies into children, criminals into saints, the broken into the whole.

This is the justice your heart has been crying out for all along—not just the punishment of evil, but the restoration of good. Not just consequences for wrongdoing, but healing for the wounded. Not just accountability for the guilty, but transformation for all.

**If you want true justice—the kind that actually works, that actually heals, that actually restores—you need God.** Not as an add-on to your own sense of fairness. Not as a rubber stamp for your preferences. But as the source, the standard, and the power that makes real justice possible.

This means submitting your understanding of justice to His. It means accepting that His ways are higher than your ways (Isaiah 55:9). It means trusting that the God who IS justice knows better than you do what justice requires.

And here's the beautiful paradox: When you submit to God's justice, you discover it's not a burden but a gift. His justice doesn't crush you—it liberates you. It doesn't condemn you—it transforms you. Because God's justice is always integrated with God's mercy, and both flow from God's perfect love. This is where true freedom comes from—justice teaches us how to pursue what is truly good for ourselves, our family, and society. It teaches us how to create covenantal communion in the light of the truth of justice, rather than destroying communion through inflicting pain and suffering on ourselves, our family, or society.

**So the question isn't whether you believe in justice.** You do—you can't help it, because it's written on your heart. The question is: Will you accept the only justice that's real, objective, and powerful enough to actually heal the world? Will you accept God's justice?

If your answer is yes, then you're ready for the next step. Because God's justice, as perfect as it is, points beyond itself to something even more astonishing: God's mercy.

## The Bridge to Mercy

Justice gives each person what they're due. But what about when someone doesn't deserve forgiveness? What about when justice demands punishment? What about when giving what's strictly owed would crush rather than heal?

This is where we discover that justice, by itself, is incomplete. Justice can diagnose the problem—it reveals what's wrong, what's owed, what's been violated. Justice can even demand restitution. But justice alone cannot heal the deepest wounds or restore broken relationships. Justice prepares the ground, but it cannot make things grow.

Think about it: Justice can tell you that you've been wronged and deserve recompense. But justice alone cannot heal your wounded heart. Justice can demand that the offender acknowledge their sin and accept consequences. But justice alone cannot transform them into a new person. Justice can establish that a relationship has been violated. But justice alone cannot restore the trust and intimacy that were lost.

**This is how justice prepares for mercy:** Justice establishes the truth about what's been broken, making mercy meaningful rather than cheap. Justice names the wound, making mercy's healing powerful rather than superficial. Justice acknowledges the debt, making mercy's forgiveness costly rather than casual. Without justice, mercy would be mere sentimentality—pretending nothing's wrong, enabling sin, cheapening grace. When we uphold justice, mercy becomes the most powerful force in the universe.

This is where the next facet becomes crucial: **mercy**. Mercy doesn't violate justice—it transcends it. Mercy doesn't ignore what's owed—it offers more than what's owed.

Justice says "You deserve consequences." Mercy says "I'll bear those consequences for you." Justice says "You broke the covenant." Mercy says "I'll remain faithful anyway." Justice says "This is what's owed." Mercy says "I'll give you what you need instead."

Without justice, mercy is meaningless. With justice, mercy becomes love that goes beyond what's required to offer what's needed—the healing, transformation, and restoration that only God can provide.
