# Preface

I collected all the words and strung them together. But I cannot claim to be the author.

I did not create the Universe.
I did not create the Earth.
I did not create the first man and woman.
I did not create myself, I was born of Barry J. and Magda Steil (they didn't create themselves either, thank you MamaLou, DaddyBob and Abuela and Abuelo).
I did not invent the English language, nor did I teach it to myself.
I did not create the Catholic Church.
I did not create the Catholic Catechism.
I did not create the Sacred Scripture.
I did not create the Catholic Faith.
I did not create the Saints.
I came to know, love, and serve Jesus from my list of saints, most notably:
    - MamaLou and DaddyBob—faithful Catholics their entire lives, parents of 11
    - My Dad—who showed me the faithfulness of a good husband and father
    - Father Rutledge—who cared so much for the younger generation
    - Laura and Ramon Reyes—who followed the Holy Spirit and introduced me directly to Jesus
    - Father Kane—who was a true shepherd and a true friend
    - John Husum and Berta Briceno—who support our youth group so much
    - Bill LaBarr—who taught me faith begins with gratitude
    - Timothy Keller—who taught me what an idol actually is
    - My son Keaton—who helped bring me back to the Catholic faith
    - My wife Tyra—who is the most important reason for me to desire God's love and gave me six sons that both helped me learn God's love as husband and father
    - The myriad of Catholic lay authors and apologists that taught me the beauty of the faith
        - Tim Staples
        - Trent Horn
        - Joe Heschmeyer

**If you're not Catholic**, I invite you to journey with me anyway. The truths about love I've discovered through this tradition are universal—they speak to the human heart regardless of where you're starting from. You don't need to agree with everything to benefit from exploring authentic love together.

There is not a single idea or principle that I created or came up with for this book.

Just as the Church receives the truth from God and faithfully transmits it through the ages, I have received this truth from God through the Church—through Scripture, the Catechism, the saints, and the faithful witnesses listed above. God gave me a desire to enjoy organizing facts and synthesizing them, and a heart to share what I've received.

My prayer my whole life has been to be able to share the deep Love that God shared with me in a way that just makes sense to people.

The author of this book is the Holy Spirit working through the Church.

I am not claiming any semblance of "divine revelation" here. Only that I see my entire life—and yours—as divinely inspired. As I like to say, our entire existence is "super-natural"!

And through the Holy Spirit, I am just trying to gather all the wisdom of our Creator into—I hope—the most meaningful book you will ever read.

This book will help you understand everything that the Sacred Scripture and the Church teach about God's love—that has been revealed to us through the ages and that my feeble mind could put together into a work.

This book does not stand alone. It relies heavily on and points you to the vast wisdom of the Church and the Holy Spirit in the Sacred Scripture, the Catechism, saints, theologians, and popes who have been teaching us about God's immense love for us over the ages. So look at it as a collection and pointer to the best of the Church's teaching in one place.

This book is basically putting forth what seems to me a very comprehensive definition of what God's love is and how we are to live our lives in response to it.

I call it "God's Perfect Love".

**The sacred gift of covenant**
— *binding truth, justice, mercy and sacrifice* —
— *into life-giving communion* —

And why do we need this definition?

Because we live in a world where love is misused, misunderstood, and misapplied.

And when it is, it's not love at all. In fact, it can turn downright evil.

Through this book we'll be able to understand the true meaning of love, sin, and salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ who perfectly embodied and lived out His Perfect Love.

It blew my mind when I rediscovered this golden nugget in the Catechism of the Catholic Church that helps us understand the complete context of all of the Church's teachings and Sacred Scripture as well:

<div class="blockquote">
"The whole concern of doctrine and its teaching must be directed to the love that never ends. Whether something is proposed for belief, for hope or for action, the love of our Lord must always be made accessible, so that anyone can see that all the works of perfect Christian virtue spring from love and have no other objective than to arrive at love."

And to the problem of evil the Catechism tells us how to solve it!

<div class="blockquote">
"If God the Father almighty, the Creator of the ordered and good world, cares for all his creatures, why does evil exist? To this question, as pressing as it is unavoidable and as painful as it is mysterious, no quick answer will suffice.
Only Christian faith as a whole constitutes the answer to this question: the goodness of creation, the drama of sin and the patient love of God who comes to meet man by his covenants, the redemptive Incarnation of his Son, his gift of the Spirit, his gathering of the Church, the power of the sacraments and his call to a blessed life to which free creatures are invited to consent in advance, but from which, by a terrible mystery, they can also turn away in advance. There is not a single aspect of the Christian message that is not in part an answer to the question of evil."

Wow!  I realized that if any religion, ideology, or worldview cannot explain how to triumph over evil, then it isn't worth following. I believe, when explored deeply, that the Catholic tradition—rooted in 2,000 years of Christian wisdom—provides a full answer to the problem of human-caused moral evil. **I invite you to explore this with me**, whether you're Catholic, considering Catholicism, from another Christian tradition, or simply seeking truth about what love really means.

Let us begin our deep dive into God's Perfect Love, His answer to evil, and the full salvation that He offers us through the Incarnation of His Son, the Redemption of His Blood, and the Gift of His Spirit.

**Technical note:** I also did not create the incredible AI tools that assisted me in researching, writing, and editing this book. This book is all based on the Church's teachings and the Holy Spirit's inspiration, but AI helped accelerate the process of writing this book and making sure the book is faithful to the Church's teachings and the Holy Spirit's inspiration.
