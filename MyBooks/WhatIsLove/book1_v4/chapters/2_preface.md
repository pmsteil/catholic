# Preface

I collected all the words and strung them together. But I cannot claim to be the author.

There is not a single idea or principle in this book that I created or came up with on my own.

I did not create the Universe, the Earth, or the first man and woman. I did not create language, the Catholic Church, Sacred Scripture, or the Sacred Deposit of Faith. I certainly didn't create myself—I was born of Barry J. and Magda Steil (who didn't create themselves either).

Just as the role of the Church is to receive the truth from God and faithfully transmit it through the ages, I have received this truth from God through His Church—through Scripture, the Catechism, the saints, and two thousand years of faithful witnesses. God gave me a desire to organize facts and synthesize them, and a heart to share what I've received. That's all.

When I was 19, on a Catholic retreat in Panama in February 1988, God first revealed to me this life-changing truth: "So we know and believe the love God has for us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him." (1 John 4:16) It made intuitive sense—I felt its truth deep in my bones—but I couldn't fully explain *why* it was true or *what* it meant. That moment ignited a lifelong quest.

My prayer ever since has been to understand and share the deep love that God revealed to me in a way that just makes sense to people. This book is the culmination of that journey—an attempt to explain, in an almost scientific way, just how profoundly true the statement "God is Love" really is. Not by inventing new truths, but by systematically unpacking the ancient truths in a way our generation can understand, verify, and embrace.

## Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

The faith I'm sharing didn't come to me in a vacuum. I came to know, love, and serve Jesus through real people—saints in my life who were faithful witnesses and taught me to love the Lord with all my heart, mind, soul and strength.

**My family and early formation:**
- **MamaLou and DaddyBob** (my grandparents)—faithful Catholics with 11 children including my Dad, who showed me what a faithful husband and father looks like
- **My parents, Barry and Magda**—who gave me life and raised me in the faith
- **My wife Tyra**—who is the most important reason for me to desire God's love and who helped teach me to be a good man, husband and father
- **My six sons**—especially Keaton, who helped bring me back to the Catholic faith, and all of whom taught me so much about the love of a Father being willing to sacrifice himself for his children

**Priests and mentors who formed me:**
- **Father Rutledge**—who cared so much for the younger generation
- **Father Kane**—who was a true shepherd and a true friend
- **Laura and Ramon Reyes**—who followed the Holy Spirit and poured out their love for Jesus on so many youth and adults
- **John Husum and Berta Briceno**—who lovingly supported the revival in our youth

**Teachers who opened my eyes:**
- **Bill LaBarr**—who taught me faith begins with gratitude
- **Timothy Keller**—who taught me what an idol actually is
- **Jordan B. Peterson**—who showed so many in our time what it means that the Bible is "true"
- **Bishop Robert Barron**—who makes the beauty of Catholicism accessible but inspires us to know our faith deeply
- **Scott Hahn**—who revealed the importance of understanding the Old Covenants in order to understand the New Covenant and why the Eucharist is the source and summit of the Christian life
- **Trent Horn, Joe Heschmeyer, Tim Staples, and Catholic Answers**—who defend the faith with deep understanding, rigorous theological thinking, clarity, and charity

**If you're not Catholic**, I invite you to journey with me anyway. The truths about love I've received through the Catholic tradition are universal—they speak to the human heart regardless of where you're starting from.

The author of this book is the Holy Spirit working through the Church. I am not claiming any semblance of "divine revelation" here—any more than I see my entire life, and yours, as "super-natural"!

Through the Holy Spirit, I am simply gathering the wisdom of our Creator that has been revealed through Sacred Scripture, the Catechism, the saints, and the Church's 2,000-year tradition—hoping to present it in the most meaningful way possible.

**Technical note:** I also did not create the incredible AI tools that have exploded in 2025 that assisted me in researching, writing, and editing this book. This book is all based on the Church's teachings and the Holy Spirit's inspiration, but Claude Sonnet 4 and 4.5 and OpenAI ChatGPT 4 and 5 helped accelerate the research, learning, writing and editing of this book to make sure the book is faithful to the Church's teachings and the Holy Spirit's inspiration. This is actually the fourth version of this book that I wrote trying to capture the fullness of truth about God's love and his answer to the problem of evil. "Words are hard" as they say. I used AI to help me do the research and spent hours and hours (sometimes on a single word or concept) diving deep into the Scriptures, the Catechism, the saints, and the Church's 2,000-year tradition—hoping to present it in the most meaningful way possible. I never would have been able to complete this book without using AI to help me do the research.  But fear not, this book was not "written by AI".  I was the one who directed every word based on what God has revealed to me over the years.  AI cannot understand the depths and complexities of the human heart, and it cannot know the depths and complexities of God's love.
