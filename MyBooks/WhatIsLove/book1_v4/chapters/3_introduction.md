# Introduction

I wrote this book because I have been a Disciple of Jesus for over 35 years and I want to share what He has taught me about THE most important question we can ask: **What is Love?**

Our world feels like it's coming apart at the seams, doesn't it? We hear constant cries for justice, for equity, for inclusion, for a solution to income inequality. People are desperately searching for something, often calling it "love," but like the 1980 Johnny Lee song says, they're often "looking for love in all the wrong places." It's a deep ache in the heart of humanity, a longing for connection, meaning, purpose, and peace that seems increasingly elusive.

I have been walking with the Lord for over 35 years and deeply thinking about "God is Love" and what that means.  I have observed the seismic shifts in our culture. I'm absolutely convinced of one thing: the chaos we see, the confusion, the division, the deep wounds both today and throughout history, boil down to a fundamental misunderstanding of the most important question we could ever ask:

**What is Love?**

## For the Love of Children: Why This Can't Wait

Let me tell you why this question has become so urgent for me, and why I believe it should be urgent for you too.

Years ago, when I was serving as a youth pastor in the Methodist Church, I had an experience that changed everything for me. I was working with teenagers—beautiful, energetic, hopeful young people who were asking the deepest questions about life, love, and meaning. But I began to notice something heartbreaking: these kids were being fed a steady diet of counterfeits—even flat-out lies!

One night at Youth Group I asked the group this piercing question: "Can we know absolutely for sure whether something is objectively good or bad?" Of the 15 or so youth that were there, only one raised their hand to say "yes," one timidly thought "maybe," and the rest said "no."  They told me that it was dependent on the person's viewpoint—of what "their truth" was.

I was SHOCKED to the core. This is not the language of the Church. This is not language we had ever used in the three years with them in Youth Group. I had been preaching "love" to them (a very superficial love without any detailed definition). Keep in mind, these were good and faithful youth who would say they loved Jesus, loved their parents, loved each other.

But what they were telling me was that they seemed to have been taught relativism. They were showing me the fruits of the "modernist" worldview that had successfully taught them that "there is no objective truth." It's a worldview that has been so successful that it has become the default for most people. This is the worldview they swim in every day and it had soaked in!

That's when I realized: **We are failing our children.** Not just as individual parents or teachers, but as a Church, as a society, as a civilization. Something had to be done.

Probably within the next six to nine months, in combination with all of the lies being told within the Methodist Church over human sexuality and the lack of any objective truth surrounding it, the lies being told by society to our young people about so-called "gender identity," the lies of the "Black Lives Matter" movement who claimed to be fighting for racial justice but whose solution seemed to be more racism than justice—I was at a crossroads.

I realized that the Methodist Church had no authority structure built into it to defend "truth." What is God's plan for human sexuality?  What is HIS Truth on this matter?  I was hearing from both sides who were literally using the Bible to defend "their truth" about what the Bible said about human sexuality. No one was concerned with "the truth," only "what they thought was true." I realized that anyone who said the "Bible" was our final authority could also twist the Scriptures to "their truth."

When I realized all of this, that was the day I knew I could no longer be Methodist. I was a Methodist for 20 years and I loved the Church, but I knew I had to find a Church that would defend "truth." I searched many different Christian "denominations" and found that they all had the same problem: they had no "authority" structure built into them to defend "truth." It was all based on the interpretation of the Bible.

But two things I knew were true.

God is Love.

And Jesus said the most important commandment was:

<div class="blockquote">
"Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and love your neighbor as yourself."

\hfill\small — Matthew 22:37-38
</div>

And He said that loving God and loving your neighbor was the fulfillment of the Law.

And so I knew I had to dig deeper into this Truth.  As I rediscovered the Catholic Church of my youth, I found a Church that had an authority structure built into it to defend "truth." It was based on the interpretation of the Bible, but it was also based on the teachings of the Church—BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, it looked to the ENTIRE deposit of TRUTH in our world. In His Creation! In the Human Heart! It used its brain to robustly use logic, reason, and science to understand the world that God created and the Scripture.

And so now, as I have been allowing the Historic Christian Church that traces its roots all the way back to Jesus to pour into me all of what it has discovered and teaches about God's love, I have to write this book.

And so my goal is to make the teachings of God's Love as thorough and cohesive and accessible as possible because it is the children who suffer the most when we fail to teach them the truth about love.

**This book is for the children.** For the teenagers I worked with who will end up married and divorced with court battles over children dominating their lives. For the women who believe the lies of "my choice" and "my gender identity". For the young men who are not taught the challenge and honor of masculinity in its service to love. For the countless "social justice warriors" who have never experienced true justice or true mercy and are fighting for something far less than perfect.

But here's the thing: **You can't give what you don't have.** If we want to teach our children about authentic love, we must have a basic understanding of what love is! If we want to protect them from counterfeits, it would be most helpful if we could recognize and articulate a specific definition. If we want to raise a generation that can heal our broken world, we have to give them the tools to do it. And I believe that this definition of "God's Perfect Love" ties together all of what the Bible teaches, all of what Jesus did in His life, death, and resurrection, all of what the Church teaches, and all of what the saints have taught.

**This is why this book matters.** Not just for your own spiritual growth—though that's important—but for the children who are counting on us to get this right. The children in your family, your parish, your community. The children who will inherit the world we leave behind.

They deserve adults who can answer the question "What is love?" with clarity, conviction, and truth. They deserve to see marriages that image God's covenant love. They deserve to experience justice and mercy working together in their families. They deserve to grow up knowing that they are created in the image of God, that their lives have infinite dignity and purpose, and that authentic love is not only possible but is their birthright as children of God. This is a matter of justice!

**The next generation is depending on us.** Let's not fail them.

It sounds so simple, doesn't it? Yet, getting this wrong has devastating consequences for individuals, families, and entire societies as we can see in our society. Getting it right? That changes _everything_. It's the key that unlocks the meaning of our existence and the path to true freedom, true justice, and meaning.

The shortest, most profound answer comes straight from the heart of Divine Revelation, penned by the Apostle John:

<div class="blockquote">
God is Love.

\hfill\small — 1 John 4:8
</div>

Wow. Let's just pause and let that sink in for a moment. _God. Is. Love._ If we truly believe that, if we take that statement seriously as Catholics, then understanding love means understanding God Himself—not that we can know everything about His infinite, unknowable essence, but we can know things about God from what He has revealed to us, from fundamental truths of who we are as human beings, from the reality we find ourselves in. This book is my humble attempt, guided by the immense wisdom of His Church, to help us, as fellow Catholics journeying together, grasp the incredible depth, beauty, and transformative power packed into that three-word sentence: **God is Love.**

So, what _is_ this love that God _is_? How do we begin to comprehend it? Drawing from 2,000 years of Catholic teaching, the depths of prayer, and my own experience as a husband, father, and teacher of God's love over the last three decades, here's what I have perceived as the heart of it, a definition we will explore together:

## *God’s Perfect Love*

**The sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant**
— *binding truth, justice, and mercy* —
— *into  life-giving communion* —

That's a mouthful, I know! It's dense, and each word carries significant weight. We'll unpack every piece of that definition—sacred, sacrificial, covenant, justice, mercy, communion—throughout this book. But the core idea, the essential takeaway, is this: **Real love, God's love, the love we are all searching for, is the perfect, inseparable unity of Truth, Justice, and Mercy.**

Or even shorter: God's Perfect Love is TRUE Justice AND TRUE Mercy. It requires Truth. It requires Justice. It requires Mercy. All three are like three cords of a rope. All are required to make the rope strong and complete.

Think about it in your own life, in the relationships and situations you navigate every day:

*   Justice without mercy? That quickly becomes harsh, cold, legalistic, even cruel. It can crush the spirit rather than heal it.
*   Mercy without justice? That becomes enabling, permissive, sentimental, and ultimately unloving because it doesn't uphold the truth or call us to conversion and genuine flourishing. It papers over wounds instead of truly healing them.
*   Trying for either justice or mercy without grounding them firmly in objective Truth—the Truth revealed by God? That leads inevitably to confusion, chaos, and the terrible suffering we see when "good intentions," detached from reality, pave roads we never intended to travel.

Only when we strive, empowered by God's grace, to bring His truth, His justice, and His mercy together in our minds and hearts and actions (mind, soul, and strength) can we begin to experience the kind of love, the deep peace of acceptance, and the lasting joy our hearts were created for. And even better, we will avoid much of the suffering that comes from misunderstanding or misapplying these concepts.

Separating them is like trying to separate heat, light, and energy from the sun—you end up with a distortion, something less than the real thing.

And here is the incredible gift, the breathtaking reality of our Catholic Faith: it doesn't just _talk_ about this integrated love; it _gives_ it to us and helps us live it! It provides the concrete means to encounter and live this love. Through:

*   **UNITY** in the one Church Jesus Himself founded upon Peter.
*   **COMMUNION** with Christ Himself, most especially in the Holy Eucharist, where He gives Himself to us entirely.
*   **WORSHIP** in the Sacred Liturgy, the Mass, that forms and shapes our hearts according to His.
*   **TRUTH** revealed definitively in Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition, authentically interpreted by the Magisterium.
*   **JUSTICE** taught clearly through centuries of Catholic Social Teaching, guiding how we build a society that reflects God's design.
*   **MERCY** poured out infinitely from the Cross and offered freely in the Sacrament of Reconciliation.
*   **GRACE** given abundantly through all the Sacraments, empowering us to actually _live_ this demanding but beautiful love.

The Catholic Faith isn't just about "following rules" or checking boxes to "get to heaven" or "mindless ritual." It's about entering into a life-transforming, dynamic _relationship_ with God who IS Love, right here, right now. It's about allowing that divine love to permeate our being and overflow into how we think, speak, and act—how we treat our families, our neighbors, our colleagues, and even our enemies. It's about becoming living proof that the Catholic Faith isn't just a collection of ancient beliefs, but a beautiful, true, and powerful way to live fully alive in the 21st century. And when Catholics live out their Faith in this way, when we truly live as the Body of Christ, we bring true LOVE into the world and offer the only real answer to the world's desperate search for justice, mercy, meaning, connection, and peace: LOVE.  He doesn't just want "equity" or "inclusion" or "racial justice" or "income equality" or "climate justice"—He wants TRUE Justice and TRUE Mercy—He wants TRUE LOVE for us. This may sound esoteric, but in this book I am going to show you what love is in a VERY CONCRETE way, and how it applies to our everyday lives.  Is it simple? No.  That is why it has always been a struggle for people to define it.  It is multi-faceted, like a diamond, and it requires us to look at it from many angles to see its full beauty. But I promise you, once you see it, you will realize that you have always known it deep down in your heart.

<div class="blockquote">
"I am the way and the truth and the life."

\hfill\small — John 14:6
</div>

He didn't say He *showed* the way, or *taught* the truth, or *gave* life—He said He *IS* the Way, *IS* the Truth, *IS* the Life. He is the perfect embodiment of the integrated love we seek. My deepest prayer for this book is that it helps all of us know Jesus more intimately in this way. And that through us, His Body, the Church, will shine ever brighter as the light of the world and the salt of the earth, offering the true answer to the world's desperate search for love.

> _(A Note on Humility: While we embark on this journey to explore what it means that "God is Love," we must always do so with profound humility. As the Catechism reminds us (CCC 271), God's very mystery infinitely surpasses our limited human understanding. This book focuses specifically on the Catholic understanding of His love *as He has revealed it* and how we, His children, are called to participate in that divine life, I am not presuming to fully define the infinite God Himself. I have thought and taught and prayed for the Jesus to give me His words. I sincerely pray I have done so well.

## Your Roadmap for This Journey

I feel so blessed that you're joining me on this exploration of the most vital topic imaginable: Love. This isn't a self-help book; it's a deep dive into the heart of the Christian Faith, but not to make us feel warm and fuzzy, but rather to challenge us to join Him on His mission FOR THE SALVATION OF THE WORLD! If you have a heart like I do for helping explain the Faith in plain english and in a way that makes sense to the modern world, then I hope you will "love" this book :)

My own journey into the heart of this mystery began when I was 19, on a Catholic retreat at the "Emmaus" retreat center in Panama. It was there God taught me His first lesson, one I have never stopped thinking about, rooted in the words of St. John:

<div class="blockquote">
"God is love, and whoever remains in love remains in God and God in him."

\hfill\small — 1 John 4:16
</div>

"God is Love." Wow—amazing... That one statement changed my entire life. I knew this was deep, but I had no idea! It ignited in me a lifelong quest, to figure out: "What does it *mean* that 'God is Love'?" I felt this truth deep within my bones, yet I knew my understanding was incomplete. Now, decades later, through countless hours of learning, studying, thinking, teaching, and talking – God, through His Church and most especially watching our society suffer (needlessly) with so much un-truth, it all helped bring it all together for me into a clear, concise, and simple understanding of what love truly is. And that's what I hope to share with you in this book.

I had a simple prayer back then.  Lord, help me to learn how to explain your love in a way that doesn't sound like a bunch of theological jargon, or "church speak," but rather in a way that people can understand your love in a way that just makes sense to them.

And every year since then, God has led me closer and closer.  And since my reversion to the Catholic Faith, he has given me the clarity of being able to understand His love in a way that I can share it with you, my brothers and sisters in Christ, in a way that is powerful and comprehensive.

The Catholic Faith held the key because it sees and honors all of the Truth of God including the Natural and moral law written on our hearts.  When we put this together with Bible teaching and the Church's teaching, we get a clear picture of what God's love is and how we are to live it.

There is nothing new here. This is not a new definition of love, just a clear but deep way to explain what the Church has been teaching for 2,000 years. Note also that this or any definition of love is a weak attempt to put into words the infinite mystery of God's love. But again, here it is:

**The sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant**
— *binding truth, justice, and mercy* —
— *into  life-giving communion* —

Think of this definition as a multi-faceted diamond. Each chapter will illuminate another facet, showing how every aspect of our faith fits perfectly together in God's amazing plan for His desire for Communion with US! I wrote this book to be both a plain english, starting from the ground up, explanation of what Christianity truly calls us to, but also a devotional that will help you grow in your relationship with the LORD and with those you love. And more importantly, I hope it will help you join God on His mission for the Salvation of the World.

We'll journey together through these chapters exploring this definition in more detail:

## The Journey Ahead: Chapter-by-Chapter Progression

**PART 1: UNPACKING GOD'S PERFECT LOVE (Chapters 1-11)**

**Chapter 1: The Problem of Evil** - Evil originates in human hearts when we choose against love. Perfect love is the only solution.

**Chapter 2: The Answer is Love** - God's Perfect Love—the sacred gift of covenant binding truth, justice, mercy, and sacrifice into life-giving communion—is the complete answer to evil.

**Chapter 3: Sacred** - God as the source of all love; love's divine origin and participation in divine nature.

**Chapter 4: Gift of Covenant** - Permanent, binding relationships through voluntary acceptance of God's authority as the Author of Love.

**Chapter 5: Binding** - Love unites and integrates disparate elements into harmonious whole, creating coherence from chaos.

**Chapter 6: Truth** - Love requires objective reality and cannot exist in deception; love without truth becomes manipulation.

**Chapter 7: Justice** - Love gives each person what they are due according to their dignity as image-bearers of God.

**Chapter 8: Mercy** - Love transcends justice with compassionate forgiveness, not by violating justice but by going beyond what's strictly owed.

**Chapter 9: Sacrifice** - Authentic love requires concrete self-giving action that puts others before self, not mere sentiment or good intentions.

**Chapter 10: Life-giving** - Love creates, sustains, and multiplies life—both physical and spiritual—participating in God's creative work.

**Chapter 11: Communion** - Love builds authentic community and relationship, overcoming isolation and creating genuine human solidarity.

**PART 2: IMPLICATIONS FOR CHRISTIAN FAITH (Chapters 12-15)**

**Chapter 12: Proof for the Existence of God** - The moral argument demonstrates God's existence through human capacity for love; this definition provides an upgraded moral argument that avoids Divine Command Theory problems.

**Chapter 13: The Nature of Virtues—Faith Working Through Love** - Every virtue upholds and flows from the four pillars of perfect love (Truth, Justice, Mercy, and Sacrifice), definitively refuting "faith alone."

**Chapter 14: Understanding Sin—Mortal and Venial Distinctions** - How vices deny the four pillars; explains three conditions for mortal sin; shows growth in holiness is possible.

**Chapter 15: Counterfeit Love in the Modern World** - Systematically exposes ideologies, relationship patterns, and cultural slogans that masquerade as love but fail to deliver what they promise. Shows how authentic love provides the real goods people are actually seeking: justice for the poor, compassion and belonging, true identity and peace, freedom and flourishing, security and commitment, intimacy and connection, fruitful love, lasting love, family stability, life and meaning, transforming faith, authoritative truth, authentic community, victory over evil, true compassion, true happiness, freedom in truth, and true fulfillment.

## What This Book Will Give You

If you desire any of these goods—and who doesn't?—this book will demonstrate how understanding God's Perfect Love is the only way to truly obtain them:

**You want justice for the poor?** God's Perfect Love provides it without class warfare or hatred.

**You want compassion and belonging?** God's Perfect Love creates authentic community without affirming lies.

**You want true identity and peace?** God's Perfect Love reveals who God created you to be.

**You want freedom and flourishing?** God's Perfect Love liberates through truth, not government coercion.

**You want security and commitment?** God's Perfect Love creates covenant bonds that last.

**You want intimacy and connection?** God's Perfect Love gives yourself completely, not just temporarily.

**You want fruitful love?** God's Perfect Love is open to life, not sterile and self-focused.

**You want lasting love?** God's Perfect Love endures "for better or worse, till death do us part."

**You want family stability?** God's Perfect Love puts children's needs before parents' desires.

**You want life and meaning?** God's Perfect Love protects innocent life and gives purpose to suffering.

**You want transforming faith?** God's Perfect Love works through concrete actions, not just beliefs.

**You want authoritative truth?** God's Perfect Love submits to Christ's Church, not personal interpretation.

**You want authentic community?** God's Perfect Love creates visible unity in Christ's Body.

**You want victory over evil?** God's Perfect Love conquers through sacrifice on the Cross.

**You want true compassion?** God's Perfect Love speaks truth while showing mercy.

**You want true happiness?** God's Perfect Love follows God's design, not fickle feelings.

**You want freedom in truth?** God's Perfect Love liberates from slavery to sin and lies.

**You want true fulfillment?** God's Perfect Love finds itself by giving itself away.

The counterfeits promise these goods but cannot deliver. Only God's Perfect Love—the sacred gift of covenant binding truth, justice, mercy, and sacrifice into life-giving communion—provides what your heart truly desires.

## How This Journey Transforms Us

This progression is carefully designed to:
1. **Awaken us** to the reality of evil and God's answer in perfect love (Chapters 1-2)
2. **Educate us** systematically about each component of the definition: Sacred, Covenant, Binding, Truth, Justice, Mercy, Sacrifice, Life-giving, Communion (Chapters 3-11)
3. **Apply this understanding** to prove God's existence, understand virtues, recognize sin, and identify counterfeits (Chapters 12-15)

Each chapter builds on the previous ones, creating a complete theological framework for understanding how God's Perfect Love is the comprehensive Christian answer to the problem of evil—and the only path to obtaining the goods your heart truly seeks.
