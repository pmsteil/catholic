# Introduction

Our world feels like it's coming apart at the seams, doesn't it? We hear constant cries for justice, for equity, for inclusion, for a solution to income inequality. People are desperately searching for something, often calling it "love," but like the 1980 Johnny Lee song says, they're often "looking for love in all the wrong places." It's a deep ache in the heart of humanity, a longing for connection, meaning, purpose, and peace that seems increasingly elusive.

I wrote this book because after walking with the Lord for over 35 years and deeply contemplating what "God is Love" truly means, I've observed the seismic shifts in our culture and become absolutely convinced of one thing: the chaos we see, the confusion, the division, the deep wounds both today and throughout history—all of it boils down to a failure to answer the most fundamentally human question we could ever ask, the question that lies at the very heart of who we are as persons created in God's image:

**What is Love?**

## For the Love of Children: Why This Can't Wait

Let me tell you why this question has become so urgent for me, and why I believe it should be urgent for you too.

Years ago, when I was serving as a youth pastor in the Methodist Church, I had an experience that changed everything for me. I was working with teenagers—beautiful, energetic, hopeful young people who were asking the deepest questions about life, love, and meaning. But I began to notice something heartbreaking: these kids were being fed a steady diet of counterfeits—even flat-out lies!

One night at Youth Group I asked the group this piercing question: "Can we know absolutely for sure whether something is objectively good or evil?" Of the 15 or so youth that were there, only one raised their hand to say "yes," one timidly thought "maybe," and the rest said "no."  They told me that it was dependent on the person's viewpoint—of what "their truth" was.

I was SHOCKED to the core. This is not the language of the Church. This is not language we had ever used in the three years with them in Youth Group. I had been preaching "love" to them (a very superficial love without any detailed definition). Keep in mind, these were good and faithful youth who would say they loved Jesus, loved their parents, loved each other.

But what they showed me was that society had become a much more powerful teacher, and its message was relativism. They were showing me the fruits of the "modernist" worldview that had successfully taught them that "there is no objective truth." It's a worldview that has been so successful that it has become the default for most people. This is the worldview they swim in every day and it had soaked in!

That's when I realized: **We are failing our children.** Not just as individual parents or teachers, but as a Church, as a society, as a civilization. Something had to be done.

Within the next six to nine months, everything came to a head. The lies being told within the Methodist Church over human sexuality. The lies society was telling our young people about so-called "gender identity." The lies of the "Black Lives Matter" movement, which claimed to be fighting for racial justice but whose solution seemed to be more racism than justice. I was at a crossroads.

I realized something profound: the Methodist Church had no authority structure built into it to defend "truth." What is God's plan for human sexuality? What is HIS Truth on this matter? I was hearing from both sides, and both were literally using the Bible to defend "their truth" about what Scripture said. No one was concerned with "the truth"—only "what they thought was true."

That's when it hit me: anyone who claimed the "Bible alone" as their final authority could twist the Scriptures to fit "their truth."

I was a Methodist for 20 years, and I loved being Methodist. But that was the day I knew I could no longer remain. I had to find a Church that would defend God's Truth. So I searched. I looked at many different Christian denominations. And I found that they all had the same problem: no authority structure built into them to defend "truth." It was all based on individual interpretation of the Bible.

But two things I knew were true.

God is Love.

And Jesus said the most important commandment was:

<div class="blockquote">
"Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and love your neighbor as yourself."

\hfill\small — Matthew 22:37-38
</div>

And He said that loving God and loving your neighbor was the fulfillment of the Law.

And so I knew I had to dig deeper into these Truths.

As I rediscovered the Catholic Church of my youth, I found something extraordinary: Jesus had built a Church with His own authority—a Church that took seriously the charge to defend and teach God's Truth. Not just fragments of truth, but the ENTIRE deposit of TRUTH.

Sacred Scripture? Of course. But also the witness of the early Church—writings from the first and second centuries, penned by those who walked with the Apostles or were taught by them directly. These weren't later interpretations; they were written at nearly the same time as Scripture itself, showing us clearly what the Apostles were actually teaching and passing down to the next generation.

Creation itself? Yes. The natural law written on every human heart.

Reason and science? Absolutely. The Church fearlessly engaged the greatest minds of every age, using logic and philosophy to understand both the world God created and the Scriptures He inspired.

This wasn't a church built on one man's interpretation of one book. This was the Church Christ promised would be guided by the Holy Spirit into ALL truth (John 16:13) —a Church that had been wrestling with these questions for 2,000 years.

And so now, as I have been allowing the Historic Christian Church that traces its roots all the way back to Jesus to pour into me all of what it has discovered and teaches about God's love, I have to write this book.

And so my goal is to make the teachings of God's Love as thorough and cohesive and accessible as possible because it is the children who suffer the most when we fail to teach them the complete truth about God's Love.

**This book is for the children.** For the teenagers I worked with who will end up married and divorced with court battles over child custody dominating their lives. For the women who believe the lies of "my choice" and "my gender identity". For the young men who are not taught the challenge and honor of masculinity in its service to love. For the thousands who take to the streets protesting injustice—their passion is real, their hearts are sincere—but without understanding the fullness of what justice truly is, they end up fighting for counterfeits that lead our society down destructive paths. They march for "equity" that denies human dignity. They demand "tolerance" that silences truth. They champion "compassion" that enables evil. All because no one taught them what authentic justice, rooted in authentic love, actually looks like.

But here's the thing: **You can't give what you don't have.** If we want to teach our children about authentic love, we must have a basic understanding of what love is! If we want to protect them from counterfeits, it would be most helpful if we could recognize and articulate a specific definition. If we want to raise a generation that can heal our broken world, we have to give them the tools to do it. And I believe that the definition of "God's Perfect Love" that I'm about to share ties together all of what the Bible teaches, all of what Jesus did in His life, death, and resurrection, all of what the Church teaches, and all of what the saints have taught.

**This is why this book matters.** Not just for your own spiritual growth—though that's important—but for the children who are counting on us to get this right. The children in your family, your parish, your community and society. The children who will inherit the world we leave behind.

They deserve adults who can answer the question "What is love?" with clarity, conviction, and truth. They deserve to see marriages that image God's covenant love. They deserve to experience true justice and mercy working together in their families. They deserve to grow up knowing that they are created in the image of God, that their lives have infinite dignity and purpose, and that authentic love is not only possible but is their birthright as children of God.

**The next generation is depending on us.** Let's not fail them.

It sounds so simple, doesn't it? Yet, getting this wrong has devastating consequences for individuals, families, and entire societies as we can see in our society. Getting it right? That changes _everything_. It's the key that unlocks the meaning of our existence and the path to true freedom, true justice, and meaning.

## The Church's Teaching on Love

It blew my mind when I discovered this golden nugget in the Catechism of the Catholic Church that helps us understand the complete context of all of the Church's teachings and Sacred Scripture:

<div class="blockquote">
"The whole concern of doctrine and its teaching must be directed to the love that never ends. Whether something is proposed for belief, for hope or for action, the love of our Lord must always be made accessible, so that anyone can see that all the works of perfect Christian virtue spring from love and have no other objective than to arrive at love."

\hfill\small — CCC 25
</div>

This is profound: **all** of Christian teaching—every doctrine, every moral principle, every sacrament—exists to help us understand and live authentic love. But this immediately raises the most urgent question of our time: If God is love, and we are made for love, why is there so much evil in the world? Why do we see hatred, violence, broken families, exploitation, and suffering everywhere we look?

The Catechism doesn't shy away from this question. In fact, it gives us the solution!

<div class="blockquote">
"If God the Father almighty, the Creator of the ordered and good world, cares for all his creatures, why does evil exist? To this question, as pressing as it is unavoidable and as painful as it is mysterious, no quick answer will suffice.
Only Christian faith as a whole constitutes the answer to this question: the goodness of creation, the drama of sin and the patient love of God who comes to meet man by his covenants, the redemptive Incarnation of his Son, his gift of the Spirit, his gathering of the Church, the power of the sacraments and his call to a blessed life to which free creatures are invited to consent in advance, but from which, by a terrible mystery, they can also turn away in advance. There is not a single aspect of the Christian message that is not in part an answer to the question of evil."

\hfill\small — CCC 309
</div>

**The answer to the problem of evil is LOVE!**

I realized that if any religion, ideology, or worldview cannot explain how to triumph over evil, then it isn't worth following. The Catholic tradition—rooted in 2,000 years of Christian wisdom—provides a full answer to the problem of human-caused moral evil because it has taken this problem and solution seriously for 2,000 years and has handed on the fullness of truth about God's love and His answer to the problem of evil.

## God IS Love

The shortest, most profound answer comes straight from the heart of Divine Revelation, penned by the Apostle John:

<div class="blockquote">
God is Love.

\hfill\small — 1 John 4:8
</div>

Wow. Let's just pause and let that sink in for a moment. _God. Is. Love._ If we truly believe that, if we take that statement seriously as Christians, then understanding love means understanding God Himself—not that we can know everything about His infinite, unknowable essence, but we can know things about God from what He has revealed to us, from fundamental truths of who we are as human beings, from the reality we find ourselves in. This book is my humble attempt, guided by the immense wisdom of His Church, to help us, as fellow Christians journeying together, grasp the incredible depth, beauty, and transformative power packed into that three-word sentence: **God is Love.**

So, what _is_ this love that God _is_? How do we begin to comprehend it? Drawing from 2,000 years of Catholic teaching, the depths of prayer, and my own experience as a husband, father, and teacher of God's love over the last three decades, here's what I have perceived as the heart of it, a definition we will explore together:

## *God’s Perfect Love*

**The sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant**
— *binding truth, justice, and mercy* —
— *into life-giving communion* —

That's a mouthful, I know! It's dense, and each word carries significant density and meaning. We'll unpack every piece of that definition—sacred, sacrifice, covenant, truth, justice, mercy, communion—throughout this book. But the core idea, the essential takeaway, is this: **Real love, God's love, the love we are all searching for, is the perfect, inseparable unity of Truth, Justice, and Mercy.**

Or even shorter: God's Perfect Love is TRUE Justice AND TRUE Mercy. It requires Truth. It requires Justice. It requires Mercy. All three are like three cords of a rope. All are required to make the rope strong and complete.

Think about it in your own life, in the relationships and situations you navigate every day:

*   Justice without mercy? That quickly becomes harsh, cold, legalistic, even cruel. It can crush the spirit rather than heal it.
*   Mercy without justice? That becomes enabling, permissive, sentimental, and ultimately unloving because it doesn't uphold the truth or call us to conversion and genuine flourishing. It papers over wounds instead of truly healing them.
*   Trying for either justice or mercy without grounding them firmly in objective Truth—the Truth revealed by God? That leads inevitably to confusion, chaos, and the terrible suffering we see when "good intentions," detached from reality, pave roads we never intended to travel.

Only when we strive, empowered by God's grace, to bring His truth, His justice, and His mercy together in our minds and hearts and actions (mind, soul, and strength) can we begin to experience the kind of love, the deep peace of acceptance, and the lasting joy our hearts were created for. And even better, we will avoid much of the suffering that comes from misunderstanding or misapplying these concepts.

Separating them is like trying to separate heat, light, and energy from the sun—you end up with a distortion, something less than the real thing.

And here is the incredible gift, the breathtaking reality of our Catholic Faith: it doesn't just _talk_ about this integrated love; it _gives_ it to us and helps us live it! It provides the concrete means to encounter and live this love. Through:

*   **UNITY** in the one Church Jesus Himself founded upon Peter.
*   **COMMUNION** with Christ Himself, most especially in the Holy Eucharist, where He gives Himself to us entirely.
*   **WORSHIP** in the Sacred Liturgy, the Mass, that forms and shapes our hearts according to His.
*   **TRUTH** revealed definitively in Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition, authentically interpreted by the Magisterium.
*   **JUSTICE** taught clearly through centuries of Catholic Social Teaching, guiding how we build a society that reflects God's design.
*   **MERCY** poured out infinitely from the Cross and offered freely in the Sacrament of Reconciliation.
*   **GRACE** given abundantly through all the Sacraments, empowering us to actually _live_ this demanding but beautiful love.
*   **SACRIFICE** poured out abundantly by Jesus in the Sacrament of the Eucharist and the Sacrifice of the Mass, where we offer our lives back to Him as a sacrifice of love.


The Catholic Faith isn't just about "following rules" or checking boxes to "get to heaven" or "mindless ritual." It's about entering into a life-transforming, dynamic _relationship_ with God who IS Love, right here, right now. It's about allowing that divine love to permeate our being and overflow into how we think, speak, and act—how we treat our families, our neighbors, our colleagues, and even our enemies.

It's about becoming living proof that the Catholic Faith isn't just a collection of ancient beliefs, but a beautiful, true, and powerful way to live fully alive in the 21st century. And when Catholics live out their Faith in this way, when we truly live as the Body of Christ, we bring true LOVE into the world and offer the only real answer to the world's desperate search for justice, mercy, meaning, connection, and peace.

The world doesn't just need "equity" or "inclusion" or "racial justice" or "income equality" or "climate justice"—it needs TRUE Justice and TRUE Mercy. It needs TRUE LOVE.

This may sound esoteric, but in this book I am going to show you what love is in a VERY CONCRETE way, and how it applies to our everyday lives. Is it simple? No. That is why it has always been a struggle for people to define it. It is multi-faceted, like a diamond, and it requires us to look at it from many angles to see its full beauty.

But I promise you, once you see it, you will realize that you have always known it deep down in your heart and you will see it leap out at you on every page of the Bible.

<div class="blockquote">
"I am the way and the truth and the life."

\hfill\small — John 14:6
</div>

He didn't say He *showed* the way, or *taught* the truth, or *gave* life—He said He *IS* the Way, *IS* the Truth, *IS* the Life. He is the perfect embodiment of the integrated love we seek. My deepest prayer for this book is that it helps all of us know Jesus more intimately in this way. And that through us, His Body, the Church, will shine ever brighter as the light of the world and the salt of the earth, offering the true answer to the world's desperate search for love.

<div class="callout" style="background-color: #073642; padding: 26px 34px; margin: 34px 0; border-radius: 14px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.45; color: #2aa198; border-top: 4px solid #2aa198; border-bottom: 4px solid #2aa198; box-shadow: 0 0 18px rgba(42, 161, 152, 0.12);">
**A Note on Humility:** While we embark on this journey to explore what it means that "God is Love," we must always do so with profound humility. As the Catechism reminds us (CCC 271), God's very mystery infinitely surpasses our limited human understanding. This book focuses specifically on the Catholic understanding of His love *as He has revealed it* and how we, His children, are called to participate in that divine life. I am not presuming to fully define the infinite God Himself. I have thought and taught and prayed my whole life for Jesus to give me His words. I sincerely pray I have done His love justice.

## Your Roadmap for This Journey

This book is my attempt to explain what the Church has been teaching for 2,000 years in plain English, starting from the ground up. Think of the definition as a multi-faceted diamond—each chapter will illuminate another facet, showing how every aspect of our faith fits perfectly together in God's amazing plan for communion with us.

If you have a heart like I do for helping explain the Faith in a way that makes sense to the modern world, then I hope you will "love" this book. More importantly, I hope it will help you join God on His mission for the Salvation of the World.

We'll journey together through these chapters:

## The Journey Ahead: Chapter-by-Chapter Progression

**PART 1: UNPACKING GOD'S PERFECT LOVE (Chapters 1-11)**

**Chapter 1: The Problem of Evil** - Evil originates in human hearts when we choose against love. Perfect love is the only solution.

**Chapter 2: The Answer is Love** - Presents the comprehensive definition of God's Perfect Love and explains why traditional definitions fall short. Shows how love engages body, mind, and soul.

**Chapter 3: Sacred** - God IS love; love's divine origin and participation in divine nature. Why humans can't create their own morality without God as the source.

**Chapter 4: Gift of Covenant** - Covenant vs. contract: permanent, unconditional love through voluntary submission of God's authority as the Author of Love.

**Chapter 5: Binding** - Love integrates truth, justice, and mercy into one harmonious whole. Why defining love has been so difficult—it's multi-faceted integration, not a single principle.

**Chapter 6: Truth** - Love requires objective reality and cannot exist in deception; love without truth becomes manipulation.

**Chapter 7: Justice** - Love gives each person what they are due according to their dignity as image-bearers of God.

**Chapter 8: Mercy** - Love transcends justice with compassionate forgiveness, not by violating justice but by going beyond what's strictly owed.

**Chapter 9: Sacrifice** - Authentic love requires concrete self-giving action that puts others before self, not mere sentiment or good intentions.

**Chapter 10: Life-giving** - Love creates, sustains, and multiplies life—both physical and spiritual—participating in God's creative work.

**Chapter 11: Communion** - Love builds authentic community and relationship, overcoming isolation and creating genuine human solidarity.

**PART 2: IMPLICATIONS FOR CHRISTIAN FAITH (Chapters 12-15)**

**Chapter 12: Proof for the Existence of God** - The moral argument demonstrates God's existence through human capacity for love; this definition provides an upgraded moral argument that avoids Divine Command Theory problems.

**Chapter 13: The Nature of Virtues—Faith Working Through Love** - Every virtue upholds and flows from the four pillars of perfect love (Truth, Justice, Mercy, and Sacrifice), definitively refuting "faith alone."

**Chapter 14: Understanding Sin—Mortal and Venial Distinctions** - How vices deny the four pillars; explains three conditions for mortal sin; shows growth in holiness is possible.

**Chapter 15: Counterfeit Love in the Modern World** - Systematically exposes 23 modern counterfeits (ideological, relational, and religious) showing which essential components each lacks or distorts.

**Chapter 16: The Generational Consequences** - Applies the ultimate test to counterfeits: What do they do to children? Shows how every counterfeit harms children in predictable ways and how God's Perfect Love provides what children need to flourish.

**Chapter 17: The Gospel - God's Perfect Love Revealed in Christ** - Shows how Jesus Christ perfectly embodies and fulfills every component of the definition. The Gospel IS God's Perfect Love made flesh.

**Appendix: Non-Christian Belief Systems and Contemporary Ideologies** - Comprehensive matrix showing how various worldviews relate to truth, justice, mercy, and sacrifice.

## This Book Could Have Been Called...

Each of these titles captures a vital dimension of what you'll discover:

- **God IS Love** - Because this isn't just what God does—it's who God is
- **The Answer to Evil** - Because perfect love is the only complete solution to the problem that plagues our world
- **The Sacred Gift of Covenant** - Because love is God's permanent, binding relationship offered freely to us
- **Love requires Truth, Justice, Mercy, and Sacrifice** - Because these four pillars must integrate or love becomes counterfeit
- **Why the Eucharist is the Source and Summit of the Christian Faith** - Because authentic love creates, multiplies, and builds genuine community
- **Faith Working Through Love** - Because every virtue flows from love's four pillars, refuting "faith alone"
- **A more Perfect Moral Argument** - Because this definition proves God's existence while avoiding Divine Command Theory
- **Exposing Counterfeit Love** - Because 23 modern distortions are destroying souls, families, and civilization
- **For the Love of Children** - Because the ultimate test of any "love" is what it does to the next generation
- **The Gospel Incarnate** - Because Jesus Christ perfectly embodies every facet of this definition
- **Why "Faith Alone" is incomplete** - Because every virtue including faith flows from love's four pillars, faith is never alone

But we settled on *What Is Love?* because that's the question burning in every human heart—the question our culture can no longer answer, the question this book will help you understand and live.

## How This Journey Transforms Us

This progression is carefully designed to:

1. **Awaken us** to the reality of evil and reveal God's answer in perfect love (Chapters 1-2)
2. **Educate us** systematically about each facet of the definition—Sacred, Covenant, Binding, Truth, Justice, Mercy, Sacrifice, Life-giving, Communion—showing how they integrate into one complete whole (Chapters 3-11)
3. **Defend the faith** by proving God's existence through the moral argument, showing how every virtue flows from love's four pillars, and explaining the nature of sin (Chapters 12-14)
4. **Expose counterfeits** by identifying 23 modern distortions of love and revealing their devastating impact on children (Chapters 15-16)
5. **Proclaim the Gospel** as God's Perfect Love incarnate in Jesus Christ, who perfectly embodies every component we've explored (Chapter 17)

Each chapter builds on the previous ones, creating a complete theological framework for understanding how God's Perfect Love is the comprehensive Christian answer to the problem of evil—and the only path to obtaining the goods your heart truly seeks.

I will be praying each day for you as you journey into the depth of God's love.

Let us begin.
