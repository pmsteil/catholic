# Introduction

Our world feels like it's coming apart at the seams, doesn't it? We hear constant cries for justice, for equity, for inclusion, for a solution to income inequality. People are desperately searching for something, often calling it "love," but like the 1980 Johnny Lee song says, they're often "looking for love in all the wrong places." It's a deep ache in the heart of humanity, a longing for connection, meaning, purpose, and peace that seems increasingly elusive.

I wrote this book because after walking with the Lord for over 35 years and deeply contemplating what "God is Love" truly means, I've observed the seismic shifts in our culture and become absolutely convinced of one thing: the chaos we see, the confusion, the division, the deep wounds both today and throughout history—all of it boils down to a failure to understand the most fundamentally human question we could ever ask and to live out that understanding, the question that lies at the very heart of who we are as persons created in God's image:

**What is Love?**

## For the Love of Children: Why This Can't Wait

Let me tell you why this question has become so urgent for me, and why I believe it should be urgent for you too.

Years ago, before my reversion to the Catholic Church, when I was serving as a youth pastor in the Methodist Church, I had an experience that changed everything for me. I was working with teenagers—beautiful, energetic, hopeful young people who were asking the deepest questions about life, love, and meaning. But I began to notice something heartbreaking: these kids were being fed a steady diet of relativism!

One night at Youth Group I asked the group this piercing question: "Can we know absolutely for sure whether something is objectively good or evil?" Of the 15 or so youth that were there, only one raised their hand to say "yes," one timidly thought "maybe," and the rest said "no."  They told me that it was dependent on the person's viewpoint—of what "their truth" was.

I was SHOCKED to the core. This is not the language of the Church. This is not language we had ever used in the three years with them in Youth Group. I had been preaching "love" to them (a very superficial love without any detailed definition). Keep in mind, these were good and faithful youth who would say they loved Jesus, loved their parents, loved each other.

But what they showed me was that society had become a much more powerful teacher, and its message was relativism. They were showing me the fruits of the "post-modernist" worldview that had successfully taught them that "there is no objective truth." It's a worldview that has been so successful that it has become the default for most people. This is the worldview they swim in at public schools, in the media, in pop culture, and it had soaked in!

That's when I realized: **We are failing our children.** Not just as individual parents or teachers, but as a Church, as a society, as a civilization. Something had to be done.

Within six months, everything came to a head. Lies about human sexuality within the Methodist Church. Lies about "gender identity" being fed to our young people. The "Black Lives Matter" movement claiming to fight for "racial justice" while promoting more racism, violence, and even attacking the nuclear family. I was at a crossroads.

I noticed something profound: sincere, well-meaning Christians on both sides were using the Bible to defend completely opposite positions. But what is God's plan for human sexuality? What is the truth about gender identity? What does God say about the family? Both sides claimed biblical support, but they couldn't both be right. No one was concerned with "THE TRUTH"—only "what they wanted to be true."

How could this be? What was missing? (We'll explore this crucial question in Chapter 6: Truth.)

I was a Methodist for 20 years, and I loved being Methodist. But that was the day I knew I could no longer be Methodist or even Protestant.  So many interpretations of the Bible.  So much confusion. What was I as a Youth Pastor to teach the children?  I began my quest to find what is TRUE about God's Love.

Two things I had always known were true.

First, God is Love.

And Second, when Jesus was asked which was the greatest commandment, He replied:

<div class="blockquote">
"And he said to him, 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'"

\hfill\small — Matthew 22:37-39
</div>

We must love God.  And then we must love our neighbor as ourselves.

Which raises our question once again: **What is Love?**

And then in verse 40 he says:

<div class="blockquote">
"On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets."

\hfill\small — Matthew 22:40
</div>

Jesus is telling us that in order to understand anything in the Sacred Scriptures, we MUST understand what Love is!

And so I knew I had to go even deeper than I ever had before.

As I rediscovered the Catholic Church of my youth, I found something extraordinary: Jesus had built a Church that he promised would be guided by the Holy Spirit into all the truth (John 16:13b). And Paul tells us that the Church is the pillar and foundation of truth (1 Timothy 3:15).

And so now, as I have been allowing the historic Christian Church that traces its teaching all the way back to Jesus to pour into me all of these truths it has discovered and teaches about God's love, I just had to write this book.

And so my goal is to make the teachings of God's Love as thorough and cohesive and accessible as possible because it is the children who suffer the most when we fail to teach them the complete truth about God's Love.

**This book is for the children.** For the teenagers I worked with who will end up married and divorced with court battles over child custody dominating their lives. For the young women who believe the lie of "my choice"—a lie that leads to the killing of their own children through abortion. For those who believe the lie of "my gender"—a lie that leads to the mutilation of their own bodies and possibly sterlization through so-called "gender-affirming care." For the young men who are not taught the challenge and honor of masculinity and the sacrifice of the marriage covenant but instead are taught to be "gender fluid" and "genderqueer".

For the thousands who take to the streets protesting injustice—their passion is real, their hearts are sincere—but without understanding the fullness of what justice truly is, they end up fighting for counterfeits that lead our society down destructive paths. They march for "equity" that denies human dignity. They demand "tolerance" that silences truth. They champion "compassion" that enables evil. All because no one taught them what authentic justice, rooted in authentic love, actually looks like.

But here's the thing: **You can't give what you don't have.** If we want to teach our children about authentic love, we must have a basic understanding of what love is! If we want to protect them from counterfeits, it would be most helpful if we could recognize and articulate a specific definition. If we want to raise a generation that can heal our broken world, we have to give them the tools to do it.

And I believe that the definition of "God's Perfect Love" that I'm about to share ties together all of what the Bible teaches, all of what Jesus did in His life, death, and resurrection, all of what the Church teaches, and all of what the saints have taught. This definition shows how Jesus' invitation to love God and neighbor with all that we have truly is the fulfillment of the law and the prophets—it makes the entire Bible make sense and helps resolve much of the confusion that different Christian divisions have regarding the interpretation of Scripture.

Here's the crucial insight that modern Christianity has largely missed: **If we don't understand what love truly is, we cannot understand what salvation truly is.** The two are inseparable. When Jesus says "For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16), He's not just describing God's emotional disposition toward us—He's revealing the very nature of salvation itself. Salvation IS God's perfect love breaking into our broken world, transforming us from the inside out, liberating us from sin's slavery, and drawing us into eternal communion with Him.

But what happens when we misunderstand love? We inevitably misunderstand salvation. And tragically, much of modern Christianity has done exactly that—reducing salvation to a cheap transaction, a one-time decision, a "get out of hell free" card that requires nothing of us except intellectual assent. We've turned the most profound mystery of the universe—God's infinite love poured out for us—into something we can acquire with a simple prayer, as if salvation were a commodity to be purchased rather than a relationship to be lived.

This is not the salvation the Bible teaches. Scripture speaks of salvation as transformation, as dying to self and rising with Christ, as working out our salvation "with fear and trembling" (Philippians 2:12), as becoming "partakers of the divine nature" (2 Peter 1:4). Biblical salvation is nothing less than being caught up into God's own life of perfect love—learning to love as He loves, to give as He gives, to sacrifice as He sacrificed. It's comprehensive, demanding, glorious, and utterly transformative.

When we reduce love to mere sentiment or feeling, we reduce salvation to mere forgiveness. When we separate love from truth, justice, and sacrifice, we create a salvation that costs nothing and changes nothing. When we make love optional or secondary to "faith alone," we gut the Gospel of its power and beauty. We end up with a Christianity that can coexist comfortably with selfishness, with injustice, with broken families, with lives unchanged by grace—because we've lost sight of what we're actually being saved *for*: to love as God loves.

Think about the biggest questions we wrestle with: What is salvation? What is sin? What is grace? What is the purpose of the sacraments? What does it mean to be holy? How do we fight evil? What is justice? What is mercy? How should we live? Understanding God's Perfect Love provides the framework that answers all of these questions. It's not just one theological concept among many—it's the key that unlocks everything else. When we understand what perfect love truly is, suddenly the entire Christian life comes into focus. We see that salvation is not escape from the world but transformation within it. We see that grace is not a legal fiction but real power to love authentically. We see that the sacraments are not empty rituals but encounters with divine love that change us. We see that holiness is not impossible perfection but growing capacity to participate in God's own life of self-giving love.

**This is why this book matters.** Not just for your own spiritual growth—though that's important—but for the children who are counting on us to get this right. The children in your family, your parish, your community and society. The children who will inherit the world we leave behind.

They deserve adults who can answer the question "What is love?" with clarity, conviction, and truth. They deserve to see marriages that image God's covenant love. They deserve to experience true justice and mercy working together in their families. They deserve to grow up knowing that they are created in the image of God, that their lives have inherent dignity and purpose, and that authentic love is not only possible but is their birthright as children of God.

**The next generation is depending on us.** Let's not fail them.

It sounds so simple, doesn't it? Yet, getting this wrong has devastating consequences for individuals, families, and entire societies as we can see in our society. Getting it right? That changes _everything_. God's Perfect Love is the key that unlocks the meaning of our existence and the path to true service, true freedom, true justice - true salvation.

## *God’s Perfect Love*

Here is the definition I have come to believe is the heart of God's love and our human nature:

**The sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant**
— *binding truth, justice, and mercy* —
— *into life-giving communion* —

That's a mouthful, I know! It's dense, and each word carries significant weight and meaning. We'll unpack every piece of that definition—sacred, sacrifice, covenant, truth, justice, mercy, communion—throughout this book.

While we embark on this journey to explore what it means that "God is Love," we must always do so with profound humility. As the Catechism reminds us (CCC 271), God's very mystery infinitely surpasses our limited human understanding. This book focuses specifically on the deep Catholic wisdom of God's love *as He has revealed it* and how we, His children, are called to participate in that divine life. I am not presuming to fully define the infinite God Himself. I have thought and taught and prayed my whole life for Jesus to give me His words. I sincerely pray I have done His love justice.

## Your Roadmap for This Journey

We'll journey together through these chapters:

## The Journey Ahead: Chapter-by-Chapter Progression

**PART 1: UNPACKING GOD'S PERFECT LOVE (Chapters 1-11)**

**Chapter 1: The Problem of Evil** - Evil originates in human hearts when we choose against love. Perfect love is the only solution.

**Chapter 2: The Answer is Love** - Presents the comprehensive definition of God's Perfect Love and explains why traditional definitions fall short. Shows how love engages body, mind, and soul.

**Chapter 3: Sacred** - God IS love; love's divine origin and participation in divine nature. Why humans can't create their own morality without God as the source.

**Chapter 4: Gift of Covenant** - Covenant vs. contract: permanent, unconditional love through voluntary submission to God's authority as the Author of Love.

**Chapter 5: Binding** - Love integrates truth, justice, and mercy into one harmonious whole. Why defining love has been so difficult—it's multi-faceted integration, not a single principle.

**Chapter 6: Truth** - Love requires objective reality and cannot exist in deception; love without truth becomes manipulation.

**Chapter 7: Justice** - Love gives each person what they are due according to their dignity as image-bearers of God.

**Chapter 8: Mercy** - Love transcends justice with compassionate forgiveness, not by violating justice but by going beyond what's strictly owed.

**Chapter 9: Sacrifice** - Authentic love requires concrete self-giving action that puts others before self, not mere sentiment or good intentions.

**Chapter 10: Life-Giving Communion** - Love creates, sustains, and multiplies life (physical and spiritual), building authentic community and relationship that overcomes isolation. The goal of perfect love is communion with God and others.

**PART 2: IMPLICATIONS FOR CHRISTIAN FAITH (Chapters 11-14)**

**Chapter 11: Proof for the Existence of God** - The moral argument demonstrates God's existence through human capacity for love; this definition provides an upgraded moral argument that avoids Divine Command Theory problems.

**Chapter 12: The Nature of Virtues—Faith Working Through Love** - Every virtue upholds and flows from the four pillars of perfect love (Truth, Justice, Mercy, and Sacrifice), definitively refuting "faith alone."

**Chapter 13: Understanding Sin—Mortal and Venial Distinctions** - How vices deny the four pillars; explains three conditions for mortal sin; shows growth in holiness is possible.

**Chapter 14: Counterfeit Love in the Modern World** - Systematically exposes 23 modern counterfeits (ideological, relational, and religious) showing which essential components each lacks or distorts.

**Chapter 15: The Generational Consequences** - Applies the ultimate test to counterfeits: What do they do to children? Shows how every counterfeit harms children in predictable ways and how God's Perfect Love provides what children need to flourish.

**Chapter 16: The Gospel - God's Perfect Love Revealed in Christ** - Shows how Jesus Christ perfectly embodies and fulfills every component of the definition. The Gospel IS God's Perfect Love made flesh.

**Appendix: Non-Christian Belief Systems and Contemporary Ideologies** - Comprehensive matrix showing how various worldviews relate to truth, justice, mercy, and sacrifice.

## This Book Could Have Been Called...

Each of these titles captures a vital dimension of what you'll discover:

- **God IS Love** - Because this isn't just what God does—it's who God is
- **The Answer to Evil** - Because perfect love is the only complete solution to the problem that plagues our world
- **The Sacred Gift of Covenant** - Because love is God's permanent, binding relationship offered freely to us
- **The Gospel Incarnate** - Because Jesus Christ perfectly embodies every facet of this definition
- **Why the Eucharist is the Source and Summit of the Christian Faith** - Because authentic love creates, multiplies, and builds genuine communion of the faithful
- **Faith Working Through Love** - Because every virtue flows from love's four pillars, proving "faith alone" is incomplete
- **Exposing Counterfeit Love** - Because 23 modern distortions are destroying souls, families, and civilization
- **For the Love of Children** - Because the ultimate test of any "love" is what it does to the next generation

But we specifically chose *What Is Love?* because that's the question burning in every human heart—the question our culture can no longer answer, the question this book will help you understand and live.

I will be praying each day for you as you journey into the depth of God's love.

Let us begin.
