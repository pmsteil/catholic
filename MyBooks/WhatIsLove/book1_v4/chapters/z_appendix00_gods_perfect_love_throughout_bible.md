Gods Perfect Love Script


God’s Perfect Love in Scripture: A Living Reading Script (Expanded)

In the beginning, God created us in love. He said: “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness” (Genesis 1:26–27). That means each of us carries His divine fingerprint. We are not just bodies. We are body, mind, and soul — integrated beings created for relationship. Saint Paul prayed that our whole “spirit, soul, and body” be kept blameless (1 Thessalonians 5:23). Jesus Himself commanded: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind, and all your strength” (Mark 12:30).
And deep inside, every human heart knows this longing. As Saint Augustine confessed: “You have made us for Yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in You.”

The Psalmist cries out: “As a deer longs for streams of water, so my soul longs for you, O God” (Psalm 42:1). We feel that thirst. But how do we begin to walk with God? “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom” (Proverbs 9:10). Not fear as in terror, but holy reverence, awe, and humility. Wisdom begins when we acknowledge Him as our Creator and open ourselves to His love.

God’s covenant love reveals His heart. To Moses, the Lord declared: “The LORD, the LORD God, merciful and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness” (Exodus 34:6). Yet He also added: “By no means clearing the guilty” (Exodus 34:7). Here is the mystery: perfect mercy, perfect justice, and perfect truth together. For mercy without truth is indulgence. Justice without truth is tyranny. Truth without mercy and justice becomes cold and lifeless. But in God’s Perfect Love, truth, justice, and mercy embrace. The Psalmist sang it this way: “Steadfast love and faithfulness meet; righteousness and peace kiss each other” (Psalm 85:10).
The truth is not an idea — the truth is God Himself. He is the reality of our existence, the source of all that is good, true, and beautiful. He created us for love: to love and to be loved. To live truthfully is to live in love — to do what is good and to walk in beauty, even through suffering. For in the depths of the soul, God’s love shines forth as joy, peace, and communion.

That promise became flesh in Jesus Christ. “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16) - ultimate existence is the ultimate good, complete lack of good or sin/evil leads to death, non-existence. Saint John tells us: “In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as expiation for our sins” (1 John 4:10). Jesus is love incarnate (Eucharist is body, blood, soul and divinity). He healed the sick, forgave sinners, welcomed the lost, and gave us the Great Commandment: love God fully and love your neighbor as yourself.
And then He showed the depth of love: “Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends” (John 15:13).

On the Cross, mercy, justice, and truth converged. “God proves His love for us in this: while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8). The innocent Lamb bore our sins — whole truth of our lack as humans acknowledged, perfect justice satisfied, ultimate mercy poured out. At the Last Supper, He lifted the cup and said: “This is the new covenant in my blood, poured out for you for the forgiveness of sins” (Luke 22:20).

Saint Paul exclaims: “Because of His great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ — it is by grace you have been saved. And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with Him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, in order that in the coming ages He might show the incomparable riches of His grace, expressed in His kindness to us in Christ Jesus. For it is by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God — not by works, so that no one may boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them” (Ephesians 2:4–10).

Here we see that salvation is pure gift — grace freely given, received by faith, yet never meant to remain static. God’s love works in us and through us. We are not saved by our own works apart from grace, but neither are we saved by faith alone that remains idle. We are God’s workmanship, made for good works, so that His saving love might flow into the world. Salvation is God’s love transforming us, making us living instruments by which His mercy, justice, and truth reach not only ourselves, but through us, the whole world.

And this love draws us into communion. Jesus prayed to His Father: “That they may all be one, as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us” (John 17:21). He longed for us to share in His very life. Through the Spirit, “God’s love is poured into our hearts” (Romans 5:5).
At the Eucharist, Jesus fulfills His promise: “Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life… whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in them” (John 6:54, 56). Here, love becomes food. Communion is not symbolic. It is life-giving union with the Triune God.
The sacraments are God’s way of making us sacred — vessels filled with His truth, justice, mercy, and love. In baptism, confirmation, Eucharist, reconciliation, marriage, holy orders, and anointing of the sick, God pours Himself into us. He strengthens us, sanctifies us, and equips us to enact His commandments of love in the world, overcoming evil with good.

And this love overflows into worship. The Holy Mass is our highest act of love. In it, heaven and earth meet. We offer back to God the sacrifice of Christ made present on the altar. It is our very best attempt to give God His due — and yet it is only a faint shadow of the infinite glory He deserves. Still, God delights in this offering because it unites us to Christ’s own perfect sacrifice of love.
Every Mass is the place where truth, justice, mercy, and sacrifice converge into communion. It is the heart of Catholic life, where we are renewed as sacred vessels of His love, sent forth to live the truth and bring His mercy and justice into the world.

So what does all of this mean? Saint John says it plainly: “God is love” (1 John 4:8). He loved us first. He gave Himself as a sacred, sacrificial covenant binding truth, justice, and mercy. He calls us into communion with Himself. And now He calls us to love: “Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another” (1 John 4:11).
To live as a Catholic Christian is to worship the God who created us in love, to seek His mercy, to act justly, to live in truth, to love our neighbor, to receive the sacraments, and to remain in His love. Jesus said: “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another” (John 13:35).

From Genesis to Revelation, the story is one: God made us for Himself. He pursued us in our sin. He gave us His Son. He poured out His Spirit. He gave us the sacraments and the Mass. And now He invites us into eternal communion. Truly: “We have come to know and to believe the love God has for us” (1 John 4:16). For indeed, God is Love.

Saint Paul exclaims: “Because of His great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ — it is by grace you have been saved. And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with Him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, in order that in the coming ages He might show the incomparable riches of His grace, expressed in His kindness to us in Christ Jesus. For it is by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God — not by works, so that no one may boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them” (Ephesians 2:4–10).

Here we see that salvation is pure gift — grace freely given, received by faith, yet never meant to remain static. God’s love works in us and through us. We are not saved by our own works apart from grace, but neither are we saved by faith alone that remains idle. We are God’s workmanship, made for good works, so that His saving love might flow into the world. Salvation is God’s love transforming us, making us living instruments by which His mercy, justice, and truth reach not only ourselves, but through us, the whole world.
