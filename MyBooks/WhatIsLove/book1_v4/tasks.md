# Tasks for the book

- Address pride vs. humility more deeply at some point - the humility of each person to properly receive the fullness of God's Truth, Justice and Mercy from the Church and God instead of on their own.  That a true Christian desires to give his life for the other, rather than demanding the life of the other to force God's love on the other.
- Create a whole chapter on the explaining the political spectrum using the triangle of the political left (focus on mercy), the right (focus on justice), the center (not deeply committed to truth, justice or mercy) and the top of the triangle is focused on truth.  That the Christian eleveates the entire political discussion to consider all of God's truth, justice, mercy in order to make moral decisions for the common good. And this means that the Christian must be willing to learn deeply about God's truth, justice, mercy and sacrifice and all the virtues that flow from them in order to help make moral decisions for the common good so that people can have the true freedom to live a life of communion with God and others.
