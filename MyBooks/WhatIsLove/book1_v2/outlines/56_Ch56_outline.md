# Chapter 56 Outline: Holiness: Love's Sacred Calling

## Chapter Title:

56: Holiness: Love's Sacred Calling

## Part V Context:

Continuing the exploration of the Practices of Love, this chapter focuses on Holiness. Building on the examples of the Saints (Ch 55), Holiness is presented not as an optional extra for a select few, but as the universal **sacred calling** for all Christians—the call to perfection in love (Charity), achieved through grace and the practices of the Christian life, leading to **life-giving communion**.

## I. Opening

**Key Scripture Verse**: "...but as he who called you is holy, be holy yourselves in all your conduct; since it is written, 'You shall be holy, for I am holy.'" -- _1 Peter 1:15-16_

**Key CCC Reference(s)**: 2013 (All Christians called to fullness of Christian life and perfection of charity/holiness)

## II. Body: Developing the Theme

1.  **Transition: From Examples to Universal Call:**
    *   Recap Ch 55: The Saints show us holiness is possible.
    *   Introduce Holiness: This isn't just for them; it's a universal call (CCC 2013, Lumen Gentium 40). Every baptized person is called to strive for holiness, the perfection of love. It's our **sacred calling**.
2.  **Defining Holiness: Perfection of Charity:**
    *   Define Holiness primarily as the perfection of Charity (love of God and neighbor - Ch 18). It means being set apart for God (**sacred**), conforming our lives fully to His will (Obedience - Ch 38).
    *   It involves purification from sin and growth in virtue (Ch 30ff, Ch 49).
    *   > "Thus it is evident to everyone, that all the faithful of Christ of whatever rank or status, are called to the fullness of the Christian life and to the perfection of charity..." -- Lumen Gentium, 40 (Vatican II)
    *   > "You cannot be half a saint; you must be a whole saint or no saint at all." -- St. Therese of Lisieux
    *   > "Do not be afraid of holiness. It will take away none of your energy, vitality or joy. On the contrary, you will become what the Father had in mind when he created you, and you will be faithful to your deepest self." -- Pope Francis, *Gaudete et Exsultate*, 32
3.  **Rooted in Baptism:**
    *   Our call to holiness begins at Baptism, when we receive sanctifying grace (Ch 15) and become temples of the Holy Spirit (Ch 17) and members of Christ's Body (Ch 50).
4.  **Achieved Through Grace and Practice:**
    *   Reiterate that holiness is impossible by human effort alone. It requires God's grace (Ch 15).
    *   It also requires our active cooperation through the practices discussed in Part V: participation in the Church (Ch 50), self-denial (Ch 51), Sacraments (Ch 52), Prayer (Ch 53), living virtuously within our state in life (e.g., Family Ch 54). Requires **sacrifice** and **diligence**. (cf. St. Therese quote below).
5.  **Holiness in Daily Life:**
    *   Counter the idea that holiness is only for monks or nuns. It's lived out in ordinary life – work, family, relationships – by doing ordinary things with extraordinary love, motivated by Charity.
    *   It's about fulfilling the duties of our state in life faithfully (**sacred covenant**).
6.  **The Goal: Union with God:**
    *   The ultimate aim of holiness is **life-giving communion** and **sacred intimacy** (Ch 42) with the All-Holy God, both now and perfectly in Heaven (Hope - Ch 20).
7.  **Holiness and the Core Definition of Love:**
    *   Connect Holiness explicitly to the components from Ch 14: Holiness _is_ the state of living out the definition perfectly.
        *   **Sacred Calling:** Holiness _is_ this **sacred calling** to perfect love.
        *   **Sacrifice:** Requires constant **sacrifice** and dying to self.
        *   **Gift:** Holiness is ultimately God's **sacred gift** of participation in His life.
        *   **Covenant:** Holiness is living the **sacred covenant** relationship fully.
        *   **Binds:** Holiness **binds** the soul entirely to God.
        *   **True Justice/Mercy:** A holy life perfectly fulfills **true justice** and **mercy**.
        *   **Life-Giving Communion:** Holiness _is_ the fullness of **life-giving communion**.
8.  **Anecdote Placeholder:**
    *   `[Author Anecdote: A reflection on the personal call to holiness, perhaps overcoming a misconception about it, or an inspiring encounter with someone living ordinary life with extraordinary holiness.]`

## III. Closing

*   **Chapter Takeaway:** Holiness, the perfection of charity, is not reserved for a few but is the **sacred calling** of every Christian. Achieved through grace and cooperation with God through prayer, sacraments, virtue, and **sacrifice**, it involves conforming our lives completely to God's love, fulfilling our **sacred covenant**, and striving towards perfect **life-giving communion**.
*   **Reflection Question:** Do I truly believe I am called to holiness, to the perfection of love, right now in my current state of life? What is one concrete area where I can cooperate more fully with God's grace to grow in holiness this week?
*   **Further Study - Scripture:**
    *   Matthew 5:48 ("You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.")
    *   Leviticus 19:2 ("You shall be holy; for I the LORD your God am holy.")
    *   Ephesians 1:4 ("...he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him.")
    *   Hebrews 12:14 ("Strive for peace with all men, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.")
*   **Further Study - Catechism:**
    *   CCC 2012-2016 (Call to Holiness, Way of Perfection)
    *   CCC 823-829 (The Church is Holy)
    *   Lumen Gentium, Chapter V (Vatican II document on the Universal Call to Holiness in the Church)
*   **Prayer Practice:** Pray the Litany of Humility. Intention: To combat the pride that resists the call to holiness or despairs of achieving it, asking for the grace to embrace our **sacred calling** with humility and trust, relying entirely on God's **mercy** and power for growth towards perfect **life-giving communion**. (Repeated prayer, different intention focus).
