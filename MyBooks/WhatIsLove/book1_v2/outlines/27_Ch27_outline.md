# Chapter 27 Outline: Fortitude: Love's Sacred Courage

## Chapter Title:
27: Fortitude: Love's Sacred Courage

## Part III Context:
Continuing the examination of the Cardinal Virtues, this chapter focuses on Fortitude (Courage). It explores Fortitude not just as bravery in the face of physical danger, but as the essential moral strength, perfected by grace, needed to remain firm in pursuing the good and adhering to **sacred truth** despite difficulties, fear, or persecution. It is the virtue that empowers **sacrificial** love.

## I. Opening

**Key Scripture Verse**: "Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; be not frightened, neither be dismayed; for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go." -- *Joshua 1:9*

**Key CCC Reference(s)**: 1808 (Fortitude: Ensures firmness in difficulties, constancy in pursuing good; strengthens resolve, overcomes obstacles/fear)

## II. Body: Developing the Theme

1.  **Transition: From Knowing to Doing (Despite Obstacles):**
    *   Recap Ch 26: Prudence helps us discern the right path.
    *   Introduce Fortitude: Knowing the right path isn't enough; we need the strength to walk it, especially when it's difficult. Fortitude provides this **sacred courage**.
2.  **Defining Fortitude: Firmness and Constancy:**
    *   Expand on the definition (CCC 1808):
        *   **Firmness in difficulties:** Standing strong against internal pressures (fear, temptation) and external pressures (opposition, persecution).
        *   **Constancy in pursuit of good:** Persevering in doing good even when it's hard, unpopular, or requires long-term effort.
        *   **Strengthens resolve to resist temptation:** Fortitude empowers us to persevere in the face of obstacles and temptations.
        *   **Overcomes obstacles/fear:** Fortitude helps us overcome obstacles and fears (even fear of death) that would otherwise prevent us from doing good. This is why perfect love casts out fear (1 John 4:18). This strength always has to be bookended by Truth, Justice and Mercy toward God, neighbor and self. It is "just" that I would give my life for this situation?  Fortitude doesn't mean purposely seeking danger or martyrdom. It is about being strong enough to persevere when the going gets tough and yes if need be, to give my life for the truth, justice and mercy of God.
3.  **Two Aspects of Fortitude:**
    *   **Attack (Courage):** Facing dangers and obstacles directly to achieve the good (e.g., speaking **sacred truth** when unpopular, defending **true justice**) defending those who cannot defend themselves and need **true mercy**.
    *   **Endurance (Patience/Perseverance):** Bearing hardships, suffering, and prolonged difficulties without giving up (linking to Hope - Ch 20). This is often the harder part as our will's are limited and we can be tempted to give up. This is why spiritual practices such as prayer, fasting, and mortification are so important to fortify our wills and build our fortitude.  Train while things are good and easy so that when things get tough, we have the fortitude to persevere.
4.  **Fortitude Empowers Sacrifice:**
    *   Directly link Fortitude to Sacrifice (Ch 24). **Sacrificial** love requires courage – the courage to give of oneself, to endure hardship for the beloved, to stand by **covenant** commitments even when costly.
    *   Martyrdom as the ultimate act of fortitude, witnessing to **sacred truth** even unto death (CCC 2473).
    *   > "Fortitude is the guard and support of the other virtues." -- St. Thomas Aquinas (adapted from Summa Theologiae, II-II, Q. 123, Art. 12)
    *   > "Be who God meant you to be and you will set the world on fire." -- St. Catherine of Siena
    *   > "Do not be afraid. Do not be satisfied with mediocrity. Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch." -- Pope St. John Paul II (Homily, World Youth Day 2000)
5.  **Overcoming Fear:**
    *   Acknowledge fear as a natural emotion. Fortitude doesn't eliminate fear but enables acting rightly *despite* fear (CCC 1808).
    *   The ultimate fear conquered is fear of death, enabled by Hope in eternal life (Ch 20).
6.  **Distortions of Fortitude:**
    *   **Rashness/Recklessness:** Acting without prudence, taking unnecessary risks.
    *   **Stubbornness/Obstinacy:** Firmness in pursuing something *not* good, or refusing reasonable compromise.
    *   **Timidity/Cowardice:** Failing to act or stand for the good out of fear.
7.  **Fortitude and the Core Definition of Love:**
    *   Connect Fortitude explicitly to the components from Ch 14:
        *   **Sacred Courage:** Fortitude *is* this courage applied to living a **sacred** life.
        *   **Sacrifice:** Fortitude makes **sacrificial** love possible in the face of opposition or cost.
        *   **Covenant:** Fortitude helps us remain faithful to **sacred covenants** despite difficulties.
        *   **Binds:** Fortitude strengthens the **binding** power of commitment.
        *   **True Justice/Mercy:** Defending **true justice** and practicing **true mercy** often requires fortitude.
        *   **Life-Giving Communion:** Standing firm in the good, enabled by fortitude, protects and fosters **life-giving communion**.
8.  **Anecdote Placeholder:**
    *   `[Author Anecdote: A story about needing courage (fortitude) to stand up for faith or morals, or to persevere in a difficult commitment or act of love despite fear or opposition.]`

## III. Closing

*   **Chapter Takeaway:** Fortitude, or **sacred courage**, is the cardinal virtue that provides the necessary firmness and constancy to pursue the good and live out authentic love despite obstacles, fear, and suffering. It empowers **sacrificial** commitment, defends **true justice**, and enables perseverance in the **sacred covenant**, relying on God's strength.
*   **Reflection Question:** In what areas of my life am I called to exercise greater fortitude—either courage in action or perseverance in difficulty—for the sake of love, **sacred truth**, or **true justice**? Where does fear hold me back?
*   **Further Study - Scripture:**
    *   Psalm 27:14 ("Wait for the Lord; be strong, and let your heart take courage...")
    *   1 Corinthians 16:13-14 ("Be watchful, stand firm in your faith, act like men, be strong. Let all that you do be done in love.")
    *   Ephesians 6:10-17 (Put on the armor of God - implies spiritual battle requiring fortitude)
    *   2 Timothy 1:7 ("For God did not give us a spirit of timidity but a spirit of power and love and self-control.")
*   **Further Study - Catechism:**
    *   CCC 1808 (Fortitude - definition and role)
    *   CCC 1837 (Fortitude linked with other cardinal virtues)
    *   CCC 2471-2474 (Duty to bear witness to the truth, martyrdom)
*   **Prayer Practice:** Pray the Litany of Trust. Intention: To surrender fears and anxieties to God, asking for the **sacred courage** (Fortitude) to trust Him completely and to act boldly according to His will, especially when facing difficulties in living out **sacrificial**, **covenantal** love. (Repeated prayer, different intention focus).
