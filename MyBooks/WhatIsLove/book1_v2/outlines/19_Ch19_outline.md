# Chapter 19 Outline: Faith: Love's Sacred Covenant

## Chapter Title:
19: Faith: Love's Sacred Covenant

## Part III Context:
This chapter delves deeper into the first theological virtue introduced in Chapter 18: Faith. It explores Faith not just as belief, but as the essential act of entrustment that establishes our **sacred covenant** relationship with God, the foundation upon which authentic love is built.

## I. Opening

**Key Scripture Verse**: "Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen." -- *Hebrews 11:1*

**Key CCC Reference(s)**: 143-144 (Faith: Complete submission of intellect and will to God who is Truth; the 'obedience of faith')

## II. Body: Developing the Theme

1.  **Transition: Focusing on the First Pillar:**
    *   Recap Ch 18: Faith, Hope, and Charity are the theological foundations. Now, we examine Faith more closely.
    *   Why is Faith foundational? Because it's our response to God's initiative, His revelation of Himself and His love.
2.  **Beyond Belief: Faith as Personal Adherence:**
    *   Expand on the definition from Ch 18: Faith is more than intellectual assent to doctrines (**sacred truth**). It is the "free ascent to the whole truth that God has revealed" (CCC 150).
    *   It involves trust, commitment, and the "obedience of faith" (Rom 1:5, CCC 143) – submitting intellect and will.
    *   Faith isn't just "believing" a set of facts, it is complete submission of our soul to God's truth which teaches us how to love.
    *   > "To be assured of our salvation is no arrogant stoutness. It is faith..." -- St. Augustine
    *   > "We have come to believe in God’s love: in these words the Christian can express the fundamental decision of his life." -- Pope Benedict XVI, *Deus Caritas Est*, 1
    *   > "If you follow the will of God, you know that in spite of all the terrible things that happen to you, you will never lose a final refuge. You know that the foundation of the world is love..." -- Pope Benedict XVI
3.  **Faith as Entry into Covenant:**
    *   Frame Faith explicitly as our "I do" (till death do us part) to God's proposal of a **sacred covenant**. God reveals Himself and His loving plan; Faith is our acceptance and entry into that **binding** relationship.
    *   Use Abraham as the prime example: his faith was an act of trust and obedience that initiated the covenant (Genesis 15:6, Romans 4, CCC 145-146). Mary's fiat is another key example (CCC 148).
4.  **The Role of Humility and Trust:**
    *   Faith requires humility – recognizing our dependence on God and the limits of our reason. We accept truths that surpass our full comprehension because we trust the One who reveals them.
    *   This counters intellectual pride and the demand for empirical proof for everything (linking to critiques of rationalism/scientism (see Chapter 12D), related to Postmodernism Ch 11). It requires a **sacrifice** of self-reliance.
5.  **Faith Seeks Understanding (Fides Quaerens Intellectum):**
    *   Emphasize that Faith is not irrational or "blind." It stimulates the intellect to explore the mysteries revealed (CCC 158). We seek to understand *what* we believe and *why*.
    *   This leads to theology and a deeper appreciation of God's **sacred truth**.
6.  **Living Faith: Working Through Love:**
    *   Stress that authentic Faith is never passive. It must be active, expressed through concrete actions of love (Charity).  For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love. (Galatians 5:6). Our trust in the complete and full truth of God's Love.  And so we must understand His True Justice united with His True Mercy in order to live out the Faith given to us.
    *   Contrast with "dead faith" (James 2:14-26). Faith without works is not true covenantal commitment. This involves **sacrifice** (see Chapter 24).
7.  **Faith and the Core Definition of Love:**
    *   Connect Faith explicitly to the components from Chapter 14:
        *   **Sacred Truth:** Faith adheres to the truths revealed by God about Himself and His love.
        *   **Sacred Covenant:** Faith is the act by which we enter and commit to this covenant.
        *   **Sacrifice:** Requires the sacrifice of pride, self-reliance, and self-sufficiency, self-creation and self-justification.
        *   **Gift:** Faith itself is a **sacred gift** (grace), enabling our response to God's revealed **gift** of Himself.
        *   **Binding:** Faith creates the initial **binding** link to God in the covenant.
        *   **True Justice/Mercy:** Faith submits to God's revelation of His **justice** and **mercy** with our heart, mind and soul.
        *   **Life-Giving Communion:** Faith is the necessary starting point for entering into this **communion**.
8.  **Anecdote Placeholder:**
    *   `[Author Anecdote: A personal story about a time when choosing to trust God (faith) despite lack of understanding or difficult circumstances opened the door to a deeper sense of His presence or guidance, strengthening the covenantal bond.]`

## III. Closing

*   **Chapter Takeaway:** Faith, the first theological virtue, is far more than intellectual belief. It is a **sacred gift** enabling a personal, trusting commitment to God, accepting His revealed **sacred truth** and entering into His **sacred covenant**. This living faith, working through love, is the essential foundation for authentic Christian life and **life-giving communion**.
*   **Reflection Question:** Is my faith a dynamic, trusting relationship—a true **covenant** commitment—or has it become a static set of beliefs or mindless ritual? How can I actively live out my faith through concrete acts of love and **sacrifice** this week?
*   **Further Study - Scripture:**
    *   Ephesians 2 (Faith, Hope, and Charity as the foundation of Christian life as taught by the Church)
    *   Romans 10:9-17 (Confessing with lips, believing in heart)
    *   Mark 11:22-24 (Have faith in God, prayer)
    *   John 3:16-21 (Belief in the Son leads to eternal life)
    *   1 Peter 1:3-9 (Faith tested by trials, leading to joy)
    *   James 2:14-26 (Faith without works is dead)
*   **Further Study - Catechism:**
    *   CCC 142-184 (I Believe - Man's Response to God, Characteristics of Faith)
    *   CCC 2087-2089 (Faith as part of the First Commandment)
*   **Prayer Practice:** Pray the Creed slowly, pausing after key articles to make a personal act of faith and commitment related to that **sacred truth**. Intention: To move beyond rote recitation to a deeper, personal adherence and entrustment, strengthening the **sacred covenant** established by faith.

**Nicene Creed:**

I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible.

I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages; God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God; begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father; through Him all things were made.

I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets.

I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church.

I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come.

Amen.
