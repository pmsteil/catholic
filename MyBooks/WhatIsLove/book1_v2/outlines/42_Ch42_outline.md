# Chapter 42 Outline: Intimacy: Love's Sacred Union

## Chapter Title:
42: Intimacy: Love's Sacred Union

## Part III Context:
Concluding the exploration of "What Love Requires" in Part III, this chapter focuses on Intimacy. It presents true intimacy not merely as physical closeness or emotional sharing, but as the deep, **sacred union** and **communion** of persons (body and soul) that authentic love seeks, grounded in **truth**, **covenant**, **sacrifice**, and chastity.

## I. Opening

*   **Key Scripture Verse:** John 17:21 - "...that they may all be one; even as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us..." (Christ's prayer for unity/communion).
*   **CCC Paragraph:** CCC 221 - "But St. John goes even further when he affirms that 'God is Love': God's very being is Love. By sending his only Son and the Spirit of Love in the fullness of time, God has revealed his innermost secret: God himself is an eternal exchange of love, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and he has destined us to share in that exchange." (Our destiny is communion/intimacy with the Trinity).

## II. Body: Developing the Theme

1.  **Transition: The Goal of Love's Requirements:**
    *   Recap Part III: We've explored virtues and requirements like Faith, Hope, Charity, Truth, Mercy, Justice, Sacrifice, Commandments, Cardinal and Moral Virtues (Ch 18-41).
    *   Introduce Intimacy: What is the *purpose* of all these requirements? They enable and lead towards authentic intimacy â€“ deep **sacred union** and **life-giving communion**.
2.  **Defining True Intimacy: Union of Persons:**
    *   Define Intimacy beyond superficial notions (e.g., mere physical proximity, emotional enmeshment, sharing secrets).
    *   True intimacy involves a deep knowing and being known, loving and being loved, between persons in **truth** and freedom. It reflects the Trinitarian **communion** (CCC 221).
    *   It requires vulnerability, trust (built on Truthfulness - Ch 40), and mutual self-**gift**.
3.  **Intimacy with God:**
    *   Primary intimacy: Our relationship with God through prayer, sacraments, living in His grace (Ch 15). This is the ultimate **life-giving communion** we are made for (Ch 16).
    *   Requires humility (Ch 31), faith (Ch 19), hope (Ch 20), charity (Ch 18), obedience (Ch 38).
4.  **Intimacy in Human Relationships (Marriage as Prime Example):**
    *   **Marriage:** The **sacred covenant** where intimacy finds a unique expression in the "one flesh" union (Genesis 2:24), reflecting Christ's love for the Church (Ephesians 5). Requires total self-**gift**, fidelity, permanence, openness to life (Chastity - Ch 36).
    *   **Friendship:** Deep spiritual friendships based on shared faith and virtue can also be forms of profound intimacy and **communion**.
    *   **Family:** Bonds of love and mutual support within the family.
5.  **Requires Virtue, Not Just Feeling:**
    *   Authentic intimacy is built on the virtues discussed throughout Part III. It requires **sacrifice** (Ch 24), patience (Ch 33), kindness (Ch 34), forgiveness (**mercy** - Ch 22), commitment (**covenant**, Diligence - Ch 35), honesty (Truthfulness - Ch 40), self-control (Ch 41), etc.
    *   Contrast with counterfeit intimacy based only on fleeting emotions (Sentimentalism - Ch 6) or physical use ("Sexualism" - Ch 12).
6.  **Intimacy and the Core Definition of Love:**
    *   Connect Intimacy explicitly to the components from Ch 14:
        *   **Sacred Union:** Intimacy *is* the experience of this **sacred union** and **communion**.
        *   **Sacrifice:** True intimacy requires the **sacrifice** of ego and defenses.
        *   **Gift:** Achieved through mutual self-**gift**.
        *   **Covenant:** Flourishes within the safety and commitment of **sacred covenants**.
        *   **Binds:** Intimacy is the deep **binding** of persons in love.
        *   **True Justice/Mercy:** Requires respecting the other's dignity (**justice**) and offering forgiveness (**mercy**).
        *   **Life-Giving Communion:** Intimacy *is* the goal of **life-giving communion**.
7.  **Anecdote Placeholder:**
    *   `[Author Anecdote: A reflection on the difference between superficial connection and true intimacy experienced in prayer or a deep human relationship (marriage, friendship), highlighting the role of virtue and commitment.]`

## III. Closing

*   **Chapter Takeaway:** True Intimacy, the **sacred union** and **communion** of persons, is the goal towards which authentic love strives. Grounded in **sacred truth** and **covenant**, nurtured by virtue, and requiring **sacrificial** self-**gift**, it reflects the inner life of the Trinity and finds its ultimate fulfillment in relationship with God and its primary human expression in sacramental marriage.
*   **Reflection Question:** Do I seek true intimacy with God through prayer and the sacraments, and in my human relationships through virtue and commitment? Or do I settle for superficial connections based on fleeting feelings or utility?
*   **Further Study - Scripture:**
    *   Song of Solomon (Allegorical representation of God's intimate love for His people/soul)
    *   John 15:15 ("No longer do I call you servants... but I have called you friends...")
    *   1 Corinthians 6:17 ("But he who is united to the Lord becomes one spirit with him.")
    *   Ephesians 5:21-33 (Intimacy of marriage reflecting Christ and Church)
*   **Further Study - Catechism:**
    *   CCC 221 (God as eternal exchange of love)
    *   CCC 771 (Church as communion)
    *   CCC 1601-1617 (Marriage in God's plan, covenant, intimacy)
    *   CCC 2709-2719 (Contemplative prayer as intimate union with God)
*   **Prayer Practice:** Pray the Litany of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, focusing on petitions related to union and relationship ("Heart of Jesus, King and center of all hearts," "in whom dwells the fullness of divinity," "in whom the Father was well pleased," "desire of the everlasting hills"). Intention: To deepen intimacy with Christ, the source of all authentic love, asking to share more fully in the **sacred union** of the Trinity and to build human relationships that reflect that **life-giving communion**. (Repeated prayer, different intention focus).
