# Chapter 14 Outline: What IS Love, Really?: Defining the Heart of the Matter

## Chapter Title:
14: What IS Love, Really?: Defining the Heart of the Matter

## Part II Context:
This chapter begins Part II, "The Source of Love." Having contrasted authentic love with counterfeits in Part I, this chapter dives into the core definition of perfect love that will serve as the foundation for the rest of the book, explicitly breaking down its components.

## I. Opening

**Key Scripture Verses**:
* "Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest? He said to him, ‘You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the greatest and the first commandment. The second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments.’" -- _Matthew 22:36-40_
* "Love does no evil to the neighbor; hence, love is the fulfillment of the law." -- _Romans 13:10_
* "So we know and believe the love God has for us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him." -- _1 John 4:16_

**Key CCC Reference(s)**: 1822 (Charity: Love God above all for His own sake, and neighbor as self for love of God)

## II. Body: Developing the Theme

1.  **Transition: From Counterfeits to the Real Thing:**
    *   Recap Part I's conclusion (Ch 13): The world offers many inadequate answers. Now, we turn to the definitive answer revealed by God.
    *   Emphasize the need for a clear, robust definition to avoid the pitfalls of the counterfeits (sentimentalism, relativism, etc.).
2. Which type of love is this?
	* In English, we use the word “love” to describe a number of different things. In the original Greek, there are a number of words that are translated as “love” in English.
        * fileō (verb) – tender affection / friendship love
        * Used to describe close personal bonds and emotional warmth (e.g., Jesus’ love for Lazarus in John 11:3). Also used in the dialogue between Jesus and Peter (John 21:15–17).
        * philautía (noun) – love of self
        * Appears only once in the New Testament (2 Tim 3:2) where it is listed as a vice in a warning about godlessness in the last days.
        * érōs (noun/verb) – passionate love - This form of love does not appear in the New Testament. It was common in Greek literature and often associated with sensual or romantic desire. Early Christians likely avoided it due to its association with pagan mythology.
        * agapē (noun) / agapaō (verb) – self-giving, sacrificial love - This is the dominant form of love described in the New Testament. It reflects a committed, covenantal, and self-sacrificing love. It is used to describe God’s love for humanity, Christ’s love in His Passion, and the love we are called to show to both God and others. In the New Testament, the word “agapaō” is almost exclusively used to describe the love of God for us and our love for God. It is not based on emotion or affection but on willing and acting for the good of the other, even at personal cost. This concept of agapē is rooted in the Old Testament Hebrew word ḥesed, which describes God’s covenant love, steadfast mercy, and enduring faithfulness to His people.
        * ḥesed (Hebrew) – covenantal love / steadfast mercy - Frequently used in the Psalms and prophets to describe God’s unwavering loyalty and kindness. It implies not just emotion but action—a love that keeps promises and shows mercy, even when it is undeserved. In the Greek Septuagint (LXX), ḥesed is often translated as agapē or eleos (“mercy”), linking the concepts tightly across the two Testaments.
        * charity (Latin: caritas) – In Latin, the word agapē was translated as caritas, from which we get the English word charity. The theological virtue of love - In Christian theology, especially in the Catholic tradition, charity is the highest of the theological virtues (cf. 1 Cor 13:13). It means loving God above all things for His own sake and loving others out of that love for God. Charity is the form of every other virtue and the heart of Christian moral life.
    * So, in Catholic teaching, when you hear the word "charity", think "agapē" - this self-giving, sacrificial love that God has for us and that we are called to show to both God and others.
3.  **Presenting the Core Definition:**
    *   State the definition clearly and prominently, perhaps using a blockquote as suggested in the prompt:
        > **Perfect Love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and true mercy into life-giving communion.**
    *   Mention the shorter form: _Love is the unity of God's true justice and true mercy._
    *   Explain that this definition attempts to capture the essence of God's own love (Charity) as revealed through Scripture and Tradition.
4.  **Breaking Down the Definition:**
    *   Dedicate focused attention to *each* component:
        *   **Sacred:** Rooted in God's holiness; set apart from the profane; transcendent; participating in the divine life. Contrasts with purely secular or materialistic views.
            *   > "Charity... consists not in loving ourselves in God, but in loving God in ourselves and for Himself; and our neighbor also, purely for God." - St. Francis de Sales, *Treatise on the Love of God*
        *   **Sacrificial:** Involves self-giving, cost, laying down one's life (metaphorically or literally), mirroring Christ's ultimate sacrifice on the Cross. Contrasts with self-centeredness or love based only on feeling. (Connect to *agape*).
            *   > "Love to be real, it must cost—it must hurt—it must empty us of self." - St. Mother Teresa
        *   **Gift:** Given freely, not earned or coerced; a grace originating from God. Contrasts with love as a transaction or something owed. (St. Francis de Sales quote above also applies here).
        *   **Covenant:** A solemn, binding promise/relationship establishing kinship and mutual responsibilities, reflecting God's relationship with His people. Contrasts with temporary arrangements, contracts, or mere alliances based on convenience.
        *   **Binds:** Actively unites, holds together, integrates seemingly opposing elements. Love is the unifying force.
        *   **True Justice:** Giving God and neighbor their objective due; upholding rights, dignity, and right relationship according to God's standard (**sacred honor**). Contrasts with distorted or purely secular notions of justice.
        *   **True Mercy:** Compassionate action that goes beyond strict justice to heal, forgive, and restore, rooted in God's own merciful love (**sacred healing**). Contrasts with mere pity, enabling, or denial of wrongdoing.
            *   > "Mercy without justice is the mother of dissolution; justice without mercy is cruelty." - St. Thomas Aquinas, *Summa Theologiae* (Implied reference)
        *   **Life-Giving:** Produces spiritual and sometimes physical life; fosters growth, flourishing, fruitfulness (spiritual fruits); leads to eternal life. Contrasts with sterile, destructive, or death-dealing counterfeits.
        *   **Communion:** Creates deep unity, shared life, intimate participation between persons (human and divine). Contrasts with isolation, superficial connection, or mere coexistence.
5.  **The Interconnectedness:**
    *   Briefly explain how these elements are not separate but deeply interconnected and mutually reinforcing within the definition. You can't have true mercy without justice, or true covenant without sacrifice, etc. All flow from the sacred source. (Aquinas quote above also illustrates this binding).
6.  **This Definition as a Lens:**
    *   Reiterate that this definition will be the lens used throughout the rest of the book to understand God's actions and our call to love.
7.  **Anecdote Placeholder:**
    *   `[Author Anecdote: A story illustrating how understanding one or more components of this definition (e.g., the sacrificial nature, the covenantal aspect) brought clarity or transformation to a personal relationship or spiritual understanding.]`

## III. Closing

*   **Chapter Takeaway:** Authentic love, as revealed by God, is far more than mere feeling or ideology. It is a **sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and true mercy into life-giving communion**. Understanding these components is key to recognizing and living true love.
*   **Reflection Question:** Which component of this definition (sacred, sacrificial, gift, covenant, binds, true justice, true mercy, life-giving, communion) challenges my current understanding or practice of love the most? Why?
*   **Further Study - Scripture:**
    *   1 Corinthians 13 (Description of love/charity in action)
    *   Romans 5:8 ("God shows his love for us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us.") - Sacrifice, Gift, Mercy
    *   Hosea 2 (God's covenantal love despite infidelity) - Covenant, Justice, Mercy
    *   John 15:13 ("Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.") - Sacrifice
*   **Further Study - Catechism:**
    *   CCC 733-736 (Holy Spirit as God's Gift, Communion)
    *   CCC 1822-1829 (Charity - definition and characteristics)
    *   CCC 218-221 (God is Love, God is Truth)
    *   *Deus Caritas Est* (Encyclical by Benedict XVI on Christian Love)
*   **Prayer Practice:** Pray the Act of Charity. Intention: To ask God for an increase in the theological virtue of Charity, conforming one's own love more closely to the **sacred**, **sacrificial**, **covenantal** love defined in this chapter, embracing both **true justice** and **true mercy** for the sake of **life-giving communion**.
