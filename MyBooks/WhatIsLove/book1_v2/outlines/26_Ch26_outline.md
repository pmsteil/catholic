# Chapter 26 Outline: Cardinal Virtues: Love's Sacred Strength

## Chapter Title:
26: Cardinal Virtues: Love's Sacred Strength - Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, Temperance

## Part III Context:
Building upon the theological virtues (Ch 18-20) and the essential requirements like Truth, Mercy, Justice, Sacrifice, and Commandments (Ch 21-25), this chapter introduces the Cardinal Virtues. These are the foundational human virtues, perfected by grace, that provide the inner strength, structure, and practical wisdom needed to consistently live out authentic love.

## I. Opening


**Key Scripture Verse**: "And if any one loves righteousness, her labors are virtues; for she teaches self-control [Temperance] and prudence, justice and courage [Fortitude]; nothing in life is more profitable for men than these." -- _Wisdom 8:7_

**Key CCC Reference(s)**: 1804 (Human virtues: firm attitudes, stable dispositions, habitual perfections governing actions, ordering passions, guiding conduct via reason/faith)

## II. Body: Developing the Theme

1.  **Transition: From Divine Gifts to Human Habits:**
    *   Recap: Theological virtues connect us directly to God (Ch 18). Commandments provide external boundaries (Ch 25).
    *   Introduce Cardinal Virtues: These are the key *human* virtues (good habits) that shape our character and actions, enabling us to live according to reason and faith (CCC 1804). They are the "hinges" (cardo) upon which the moral life turns.
2.  **Infused vs. Acquired (Briefly):**
    *   Acknowledge that while these can be developed through human effort, in the Christian life, they are also *infused* and perfected by God's grace (Ch 15), especially through the Holy Spirit (Ch 17), orienting them towards our supernatural end. They become **sacred strength**.
3.  **The Four Pillars of Moral Strength:**
    *   Introduce the four Cardinal Virtues: Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, Temperance.
4.  **Prudence (Brief Overview - Deeper Dive in Ch 27):**
    *   Define Prudence: The virtue that disposes practical reason to discern our true good in every circumstance and to choose the right means of achieving it. "Right reason in action" (St. Thomas Aquinas, cited CCC 1806). The charioteer of the virtues. Provides **sacred discernment**.
5.  **Justice (Brief Overview - Reinforcing Ch 23):**
    *   Define Justice: The moral virtue that consists in the constant and firm will to give their due to God and neighbor (CCC 1807). Upholds **sacred honor**. (Briefly reiterate its importance as both a cardinal and theological requirement).
6.  **Fortitude (Brief Overview - Deeper Dive in Ch 28):**
    *   Define Fortitude (Courage): Ensures firmness in difficulties and constancy in the pursuit of the good. Strengthens resolve to resist temptation and overcome obstacles (CCC 1808). Provides **sacred courage** for **sacrifice**.
7.  **Temperance (Brief Overview - Deeper Dive in Ch 29):**
    *   Define Temperance (Moderation): Moderates the attraction of pleasures and provides balance in the use of created goods. Ensures the will's mastery over instincts (CCC 1809). Provides **sacred balance**.
8.  **Working Together for Love:**
    *   Explain how these four virtues work together, guided by the theological virtues (especially Charity), to enable a well-ordered, loving life. Prudence guides, Justice gives right measure, Fortitude overcomes obstacles, Temperance controls disordered desires.
    *   > "I should have no hesitation in defining them: that temperance is love giving itself entirely to that which is loved; fortitude is love readily bearing all things for the sake of the loved object; justice is love serving only the loved object, and therefore ruling rightly; prudence is love distinguishing with sagacity between what hinders it and what helps it." -- St. Augustine, *De Moribus Ecclesiae Catholicae*
    *   > "The infused virtues have their origin in grace... Charity more proximately orders man to God than the other virtues... Therefore, charity is a greater virtue than the others." -- St. Thomas Aquinas, *Disputed Questions on Virtue*
    *   > "Grace has the power to make straight the paths of human love." -- Pope St. John Paul II
9.  **Cardinal Virtues and the Core Definition of Love:**
    *   Connect the Cardinal Virtues collectively to the components from Ch 14:
        *   **Sacred Strength:** They provide the inner moral strength needed to live a **sacred** life.
        *   **Sacrifice:** Fortitude empowers **sacrifice**; Temperance moderates desires that resist sacrifice; Prudence guides sacrifice; Justice ensures sacrifice is rightly ordered.
        *   **Covenant:** Living virtuously strengthens our ability to uphold **sacred covenants**.
        *   **Binds:** They help **bind** our actions to the good defined by **truth**, **justice**, and **mercy**.
        *   **True Justice:** Justice is one of the cardinal virtues itself. Prudence helps discern it, Fortitude defends it, Temperance prevents desires from violating it.
        *   **True Mercy:** Prudence guides merciful action; Fortitude overcomes fear in showing mercy; Temperance moderates reactions that hinder mercy.
        *   **Life-Giving Communion:** A virtuous life fosters healthy relationships and **life-giving communion**.
10. **Anecdote Placeholder:**
    *   `[Author Anecdote: Example of a situation requiring the interplay of multiple cardinal virtues (e.g., prudently deciding on a just course of action that required fortitude to execute and temperance to avoid excess) in order to act lovingly.]`

## III. Closing

*   **Chapter Takeaway:** The four Cardinal Virtues—Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, and Temperance—are foundational human virtues, infused and perfected by grace, providing the **sacred strength** and structure necessary for a morally good life. Guided by Faith, Hope, and Charity, they enable us to navigate challenges, control our passions, act justly, and wisely choose the good, thereby living out **sacrificial**, **covenantal** love ordered towards **life-giving communion**.
*   **Reflection Question:** Which of the four Cardinal Virtues do I find most challenging to practice consistently? How can I intentionally seek God's grace to grow in Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, and Temperance?
*   **Further Study - Scripture:**
    *   Proverbs 4:5-7 (Get wisdom/prudence)
    *   1 Corinthians 16:13 ("Be watchful, stand firm in your faith, be courageous [Fortitude], be strong.")
    *   Titus 2:11-12 (Grace trains us to live sober, upright [Justice], and godly lives [Temperance/Prudence])
    *   2 Peter 1:5-7 (Supplement faith with virtue, knowledge, self-control [Temperance], steadfastness [Fortitude]...)
*   **Further Study - Catechism:**
    *   CCC 1803-1811 (The Human Virtues - Cardinal Virtues)
    *   CCC 1833-1839 (Virtues and Grace)
*   **Prayer Practice:** Pray for the Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit (Wisdom, Understanding, Counsel, Fortitude, Knowledge, Piety, Fear of the Lord - Isaiah 11:2-3), recognizing that these gifts perfect the virtues. Intention: To ask the Holy Spirit for the specific gifts needed to strengthen the Cardinal Virtues, providing the **sacred strength** and **discernment** to live a life fully aligned with God's loving will.
