# Chapter 29 Outline: Moral Virtues: Love's Sacred Character

## Chapter Title:

29: Moral Virtues: Love's Sacred Character

## Part III Context:

Following the Theological Virtues (the foundation) and Cardinal Virtues (the hinges/strength), this chapter introduces the broader category of Moral Virtues. These are the specific good habits, perfected by grace, that shape our character, enabling us to consistently act according to reason and faith, and thus embody authentic, **sacrificial**, **covenantal** love in daily life.

## I. Opening

**Key Scripture Verse**: "For this very reason make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love." -- _2 Peter 1:5-7_

**Key CCC Reference(s)**: 1803 (Virtue: Habitual/firm disposition to do good; allows giving best of self, pursuing/choosing good)

## II. Body: Developing the Theme

1.  **Transition: From Strength to Specific Habits:**
    *   Recap: Theological virtues directly orient us to the Love of God (Ch 18-20); Cardinal virtues provide fundamental strength and guidance (Ch 25-28) in how to Love God.
    *   Introduce Moral Virtues: These are the specific, habitual dispositions that flow from and specify the cardinal virtues, shaping our character for good action (CCC 1803). They are the "muscles" developed through practice and grace.
2.  **Virtue as Habitual Goodness:**
    *   Define Moral Virtue as a _habit_ – a stable disposition acquired through repeated good actions, aided by grace (Ch 15). It's not just doing good, it is doing justice and mercy - these are additional facets of love!
    *   Contrast with vice (habitual bad action). Virtue makes doing good easier, more consistent, and even joyful (CCC 1804).
3.  **Shaping Character for Love:**
    *   Explain that the goal of virtue is to shape our character into the likeness of Christ, who is perfect Love (the ultimate expression of True Justice and True Mercy). A virtuous character is necessary to love authentically and consistently. Consistent practice conforms our will to Christ's Will.
    >   "He must increase; I must decrease" - John 3:30
    >   "It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me" - Galatians 2:20
    *   These virtues govern our actions, order passions (Temperance - Ch 28), and guide conduct according to reason (Prudence - Ch 26) and faith (Ch 19). They build in us a **sacred character** that is directly given to us by God through grace (Ch 15).

> "Temperance is love giving itself entirely to that which is loved; fortitude is love readily bearing all things for the sake of the loved object; justice is love serving only the loved object, and therefore ruling rightly; prudence is love distinguishing with sagacity between what hinders it and what helps it." -- St. Augustine, _Of the Morals of the Catholic Church_ written ~426 AD

> "Grace does not destroy nature but perfects it." -- St. Thomas Aquinas, _Summa Theologica_, I, Q. 1, Art. 8, ad 2 (Illustrates grace perfecting virtue) written ~1274 AD

> "The proof of love is in the works. Where love exists, it works great things. But when it ceases to act, it ceases to exist." -- Pope St. Gregory the Great, Pope St. Gregory the Great’s Homilies on the Gospels, Book II, Homily 30, §1-2 written ~591 AD

1.  **Relationship to Cardinal Virtues:**
    *   Explain that the numerous moral virtues can be grouped around the Cardinal Virtues (CCC 1805). For example, generosity relates to justice; patience relates to fortitude; chastity relates to temperance. Prudence guides them all.
2.  **Introduction to Key Moral Virtues (To be explored in Ch 30-39):**
    *   Briefly introduce the virtues listed in the master outline for this chapter, giving a one-sentence description of what it is and then how each relates to justice, mercy and the cardinal virtue it is most related to:
        *   **Humility:** Foundation, recognizing dependence on God.
        *   **Generosity:** Freely giving (**sacred gift**).
        *   **Patience:** Enduring difficulties in love (**sacrifice**).
        *   **Kindness:** Gentle compassion (**mercy**).
        *   **Diligence:** Commitment and perseverance in loving action.
        *   **Chastity:** Integrity in love, especially regarding sexuality (Temperance).
        *   **Meekness:** Gentle strength, controlling anger (Fortitude/Temperance).
        *   **Faithfulness:** Loyalty to God's promises and commitments (Obedience).
        *   **Obedience:** Submission to God's will and legitimate authority (**covenant**).
        *   **Gratitude:** Recognizing and appreciating God's **gifts**.
        *   **Truthfulness:** Honesty and integrity (related to **sacred truth**).
        *   _(Self-Control/Discipline from Ch 40 could also be mentioned here as related to Temperance)_
3.  **Growth in Virtue: Grace and Effort:**
    *   Reiterate that while human effort is required to develop habits, growth in supernatural virtue is primarily the work of the Holy Spirit (Ch 17) through grace (Ch 15). It requires prayer, sacraments, and cooperation.
4.  **Moral Virtues and the Core Definition of Love:**
    *   Connect the concept of Moral Virtues collectively to the components from Ch 14:
        *   **Sacred Character:** The virtues constitute this character needed for **sacred** love.
        *   **Sacrifice:** Many virtues (patience, diligence, obedience, humility) directly involve **sacrifice**.
        *   **Gift:** Generosity embodies the **gift** aspect; gratitude recognizes gifts received.
        *   **Covenant:** Faithfulness (related to diligence/obedience) upholds **covenants**.
        *   **Binds:** Virtuous habits **bind** our actions consistently to the good.
        *   **True Justice/Mercy:** Specific virtues like justice itself, generosity, kindness, meekness directly relate.
        *   **Life-Giving Communion:** A virtuous life naturally fosters **life-giving communion**.
5.  **Anecdote Placeholder:**
    *   `[Author Anecdote: A story about the slow, sometimes difficult process of cultivating a specific moral virtue (e.g., patience, humility) and how developing that habit eventually made loving actions in related situations more natural or consistent.]`

## III. Closing

*   **Chapter Takeaway:** Moral virtues are the specific good habits, developed through practice and perfected by grace, that shape our **sacred character** in the likeness of Christ. They flow from the cardinal virtues and enable us to consistently live out the demands of **sacrificial**, **covenantal** love, fostering **true justice**, **mercy**, and **life-giving communion**.
*   **Reflection Question:** Which specific moral virtue do I feel God is calling me to cultivate more intentionally in this season of my life? What concrete steps, aided by prayer and grace, can I take to develop that good habit?
*   **Further Study - Scripture:**
    *   Philippians 4:8 ("Whatever is true, honorable, just, pure, lovely, gracious... think about these things.") - Call to focus on virtue.
    *   Colossians 3:12-17 (Put on virtues like compassion, kindness, humility, etc.)
    *   Matthew 5-7 (Sermon on the Mount - describes the character and actions of kingdom citizens)
*   **Further Study - Catechism:**
    *   CCC 1803-1804 (Definition of Human/Moral Virtue)
    *   CCC 1810-1811 (Moral Virtues grow through education, acts, perseverance, grace)
    *   CCC 1839 (Lists key human virtues related to cardinal virtues)
*   **Prayer Practice:** Pray the Litany of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Intention: To contemplate the virtues embodied in the Heart of Christ (e.g., "Heart of Jesus, patient and most merciful," "fountain of life and holiness," "obedient unto death") and to ask for the grace to cultivate these same virtues in one's own character, shaping it for **sacred**, **sacrificial** love.
