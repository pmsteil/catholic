# Chapter 16 Outline: Made for Love: Our Dignity and Divine Spark

## Chapter Title:
16: Made for Love: Our Dignity and Divine Spark

## Part II Context:
Continuing the exploration of the Source of Love, after defining love (Ch 14) and establishing the necessity of Grace (Ch 15), this chapter examines *why* we are capable of receiving grace and participating in God's love: our inherent dignity derived from being created in the image and likeness of God (Imago Dei), specifically designed for **life-giving communion**.

## I. Opening



**Key Scripture Verse**: "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them." -- _Genesis 1:27_

**Key CCC Reference(s)**: 357 (Imago Dei: Dignity of person, capable of self-knowledge, self-possession, free self-gift, communion, covenant)

## II. Body: Developing the Theme

1.  **Transition: Grace Needs a Foundation:**
    *   Recap Ch 15: Authentic love requires God's grace. But grace builds upon nature. What is it about our nature that makes us receptive to this **sacred gift**?
    *   Introduce the concept of Imago Dei (Image of God) as the foundation of our capacity for love and relationship with God.
2.  **Imago Dei: Reflecting the Divine:**
    *   Explain what it means to be made in God's image and likeness (CCC 355-361):
        *   Possessing intellect (capacity to know **truth**) and free will (capacity to choose the good/love).
        *   Capacity for relationship, self-giving, and **communion** (reflecting the Trinitarian communion).
        *   Inherent, inviolable dignity as persons, not objects. This dignity is **sacred**.
3.  **Made *For* Love and Communion:**
    *   Connect the Imago Dei to our ultimate purpose: We weren't just made *like* God, but *for* God (CCC 1, 27).
    *   Our deepest and most primary desire (beyond the material needs of survival) is for love, connection, **justice**, and **mercy** (Ch 2-4). We are hardwired for **life-giving communion**. No one teaches a toddler to desire love and to love their parents.  No one has to teach a mother to love her child or for a father to protect and provide for his family.
    *   Our deepest biological reality is to have children and actively care for their survival and an abundant life.
    *   This inherent orientation towards God is the "Divine Spark" within us, the point of contact for grace.
    *   Human Psychology (Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs) shows that we are hardwired for love and connection.
    *   > "You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our heart is restless until it rests in you." -- St. Augustine, *Confessions*, Book 1, Ch 1
    *   > "Man cannot live without love. He remains a being that is incomprehensible for himself, his life is senseless, if love is not revealed to him, if he does not encounter love, if he does not experience it and make it his own, if he does not participate intimately in it." -- St. John Paul II, *Redemptor Hominis*, 10
    *   > "Christian, recognize your dignity and, now that you share in God's own nature, do not return to your former base condition by sinning." -- St. Leo the Great, *Sermo 21*
4.  **Dignity Persists Despite Sin:**
    *   Acknowledge the effects of Original Sin (Ch 1): Our nature is wounded, intellect darkened, will weakened.
    *   However, the fundamental dignity of being made in God's image remains (CCC 405). This is why redemption and grace are possible. God doesn't give up on His creation. God gave us the wonderful gift of LOVE to counteract the effects of sin.  Sin itself has no power, sin is the absence of love - Love has great power to move hearts, activate men, build societies, build more just institutions and governments. But a less perfect love also has power to effect less perfect activations of the intellect and will.
5.  **Contrast with Counterfeit Views of Humanity:**
    *   Briefly contrast the Catholic view of inherent dignity with how counterfeits diminish it:
        *   Materialism/Marxism (Ch 10): All people are created for material wealth and power.
        *   Individualism (Ch 8): All people are created for self-preservation and self-fulfillment.
        *   "Sexualism" (Ch 12): All people are created for sexual pleasure.
        *   Relativism (Ch 7): All people are created with their own opinions of morality.
        *   Postmodernism (Ch 11): All people are created for ??? - there is no objective meaning of purpose for the human life.
    *   Authentic love always recognizes and honors the **sacred** dignity of the other person.
6.  **Love as Our Core Vocation:**
    *   Because we are made in the image of a God who *is* Love, our fundamental calling (vocation) is to love â€“ to live out the **sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant** (CCC 1604, applied broadly). Our dignity empowers and calls us to this. More on vocations in Chapter 54A.
7.  **Connecting Dignity to the Core Definition:**
    *   How does being "Made for Love" enable the definition from Ch 14?
        *   Our dignity makes us capable recipients of the **sacred gift** of grace.
        *   Our relational nature equips us for **covenant**.
        *   Our intellect/will allows us to strive for **true justice** and **true mercy** (aided by grace) to honor the dignity of all people.
        *   Our desire to love and for love finds fulfillment and purpose in **life-giving communion**.
        *   Living out this dignity requires **sacrifice** against our fallen inclinations.
8.  **Anecdote Placeholder:**
    *   `[Author Anecdote: A story about recognizing the profound, inherent dignity in someone often overlooked or marginalized by society, leading to a deeper appreciation for the Imago Dei and the call to love them.]`

## III. Closing

*   **Chapter Takeaway:** Chapter 16 reveals that our **sacred** dignity, rooted in being created in the Imago Dei, is the very foundation of our capacity for authentic love. This inherent 'Divine Spark' makes us receptive to the **sacred gift** of grace, empowering us to fulfill our core vocation: to offer the **sacred, sacrificial gift** of **covenant-binding truth, justice, and mercy**, which in turn cultivates **life-giving communion** with God and others.
*   **Reflection Question:** How does recognizing my own inherent dignity (and the dignity of every other person) as rooted in the Imago Dei change the way I view myself, others, and my responsibility to love?
*   **Further Study - Scripture:**
    *   Psalm 139 ("You made me, Lord, and knit me together in my mother's womb.")
    *   Psalm 8 ("What is man that you are mindful of him... yet you have crowned him with glory and honor.")
    *   Wisdom 2:23 ("For God created man for incorruption, and made him in the image of his own eternity.")
    *   Colossians 3:10 ("...and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.")
    *   1 John 3:1-2 ("See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God...")
*   **Further Study - Catechism:**
    *   CCC 355-384 (Man in the Image of God, Body and Soul, Male and Female, Man in Paradise)
    *   CCC 1700-1715 (Dignity of the Human Person, Beatitude)
*   **Prayer Practice:** Pray the Te Deum (or another prayer of praise like the Gloria). Intention: To give thanks and praise to God for the **sacred gift** of creation, for bestowing upon humanity such profound dignity (Imago Dei), and for calling us into **covenant** and **life-giving communion** through His love and grace.

Te Deum ()

HOLY God, we praise Thy Name
Lord of all we bow before Thee;
all on earth Thy scepter claim,
all in heaven above adore Thee;
Infinite Thy vast domain,
everlasting is Thy reign.

HARK, the loud celestial hymn
angel choirs above are raising;
Cherubim and Seraphim
in unceasing chorus praising,
fill the heavens with sweet accord;
Holy, Holy, Holy Lord!

LO, the Apostolic train
Join, Thy sacred name to hallow:
prophets swell the loud refrain,
and the white-robed Martyrs follow;
and, from morn till set of sun,
through the Church the song goes on.

HOLY Father, Holy Son,
Holy Spirit, Three we name Thee,
While in essence only One,
undivided God we claim Thee:
and, adoring, bend the knee
while we own the mystery.

THOU art King of glory, Christ:
Son of God, yet born of Mary;
for us sinners sacrificed,
and to death a tributary:
first to break the bars of death,
Thou has opened heaven to faith.

FROM Thy high celestial home,
Judge of all, again returning,
we believe that Thou shalt come
in the dreaded Doomsday morning;
when Thy voice shall shake the earth,
and the startled dead come forth.

THEREFORE do we pray Thee, Lord:
help Thy servants whom, redeeming
by Thy Precious Blood out-poured,
Thou hast saved from Satan's scheming.
Give to them eternal rest
in the glory of the Blest.

SPARE Thy people, Lord, we pray,
by a thousand snares surrounded:
keep us without sin today,
never let us be confounded.
Lo, I put my trust in Thee;
never, Lord, abandon me.
