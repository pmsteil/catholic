ðŸ•Š Prayer for Deeper Communion

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

Lord Jesus,
You who know every depth of the human heart,
I pray for the one reading these words right now.
Not by chance, but by Your divine love,
You have drawn them here.

Unveil Yourself to them in a way they have never known.
Not only in words, but in silence.
Not only in joy, but in sorrow.
Not only in strength, but in their weakness.

Let them taste the burning mercy of Your Sacred Heart.
Let them see, in their own wounds, the imprint of Your Cross.
Let them feel the embrace of the Father,
the fire of the Spirit,
and the tenderness of Your gaze that never looks away.

Break every barrier that keeps them from You.
Speak into every lie that has told them they are not loved.
Overwhelm them with the truth that they were made
for communion, for redemption, for glory.

Bring them beyond the surface,
into the deep,
where You dwellâ€”
and where they will never be alone again.

Our Father...

Hail Mary...

Glory be...

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
