Need a Summary Chapter called "The Catholic Good News" that summarizes the entire book.
	- Catholicism is a comprehensive teaching about the Love of Father, Son and Holy Spirit and loving our Neighbor and ourselves.
	- Everything the Church does is to point us to and help us grow in our Love for God and Neighbor
	- Never once in this whole book did we speak of "earning our salvation", rather, actual salvation from actual sin is a gift from God, given to us through all Truth and Revelation of how we are to love God and Neighbor.
	- If we live in love, we are saved. If we live in love, we are sanctified. If we live in love, we are glorified.
	> "The glory of God is man fully alive, and the life of man is the vision of God." -- St. Irenaeus, *Against Heresies*, Book IV, 20, 7
    - If we are living in love, we never presume or even worry about our eternal salvation - we simply practice and grow in the **life-giving communion** with God and Neighbor through Christ and His Church.
	- Any one who is opposed to the good works of love, is opposed to the Good News of the Gospel.
	> "There was a scholar of the law[b] who stood up to test him and said, “Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” Jesus said to him, “What is written in the law? How do you read it?” He said in reply, “You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your being, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.” He replied to him, “You have answered correctly; do this and you will live.”" -- Luke 10:25-28
