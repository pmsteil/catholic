# **RCIA Devotional: The Seven Last Words of Christ**

**(Final session in Preparation for the Easter Vigil)**

**Leader:** As we approach the Easter Vigil, where you will be fully initiated into the Body of Christ through the Sacraments, we take this time to reflect deeply on the ultimate act of love shown on the Cross. The Seven Last Words of Christ offer a profound window into His heart and the meaning of His sacrifice. Let us meditate on these words, allowing them to prepare our hearts for the mysteries we are about to celebrate.

I will read each of the Seven Last Words, followed by a brief reflection and a moment of silence for personal prayer. After each reflection, we will pray together. This is a time to open your heart to the love and mercy of Jesus as you prepare for your initiation into the Church. Note that the prayers are prayers of community - because we are all part of the Body of Christ, we pray together as one family.

Now, Let begin our prayer as we always do...

**(Opening Prayer)**

*Leader:*  In the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.  Heavenly Father, as we gather in these final moments before the Easter Vigil, open our hearts and minds to receive the depth of Your love revealed in the final words of Your Son, Jesus Christ. May His sacrifice penetrate our souls, drawing us closer to You and preparing us for the new life You offer. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.

**1. "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."** (Luke 23:34)

- **Leader:** Jesus begins His final hours with a prayer of radical forgiveness, showing boundless mercy even to those who torture Him. He embodies the divine mercy that awaits us, even when we don't fully grasp the weight of our own sins. As you prepare for Baptism and Confirmation, consider the freedom that comes from receiving God's forgiveness and the call to extend that same mercy to others. This is love in action – offering mercy even when justice might demand otherwise.
    - **Question:** *Where in my life do I need to receive or extend God's forgiveness?* (30 seconds to 1 minute of silence)
- **Prayer(All):** Lord Jesus, teach us to forgive as You forgive. Grant us hearts of mercy, ready to receive Your pardon and share it freely. Amen.

**2. "Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise."** (Luke 23:43)

- **Leader:** To the repentant thief, Jesus offers immediate hope and assurance. This promise reveals the power of faith and repentance, even at the last moment. Paradise is life-giving communion with God. His promise underscores the truth that God's kingdom is open to all who turn to Him with sincere hearts. This is a promise for each of you and all who enter into the covenant family of the Church.
    - **Question:** *How does Christ's promise of Paradise give me hope on my journey?* (30 seconds to 1 minute of silence)
- **Prayer(All):** Jesus, remember us when You come into Your kingdom. Strengthen our faith and trust in Your promise of eternal life. Amen.

**3. "Woman, behold your son! ... Behold your mother!"** (John 19:26-27)

- **Leader:** Jesus creates a new family from the foot of the Cross, entrusting His mother Mary to the beloved disciple John, and John to Mary. He establishes the Church as a family, bound not by blood but by faith and love. Mary becomes our spiritual mother, guiding and protecting us. As you join the Church, you are welcomed into this spiritual family, called to love and support one another. This is the covenant-binding nature of love – creating lasting bonds.
    - **Question:** *How can I embrace Mary as my mother and the Church as my family?* (30 seconds to 1 minute of silence)
- **Prayer(All):** Lord Jesus, thank You for the gift of Your mother and the family of the Church. Help us to live as true brothers and sisters in You. Amen.

**4. "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"** (Matthew 27:46; Mark 15:34)

- **Leader:** This cry reveals the depth of Jesus' human suffering and His solidarity with us. By quoting Psalm 22's opening, Jesus expresses this profound suffering while simultaneously invoking the psalm's powerful movement from desolation to trust and God's ultimate triumph. He enters fully into our human experience, even the feeling of abandonment, bridging the gap sin created between humanity and God. He takes on the ultimate consequence of sin – separation from the Father – so that we never have to, pointing even in His agony towards the final victory.
    - **Question:** *How does knowing Jesus shared our deepest struggles, yet simultaneously pointed towards hope and God's ultimate victory, comfort and strengthen you?* (30 seconds to 1 minute of silence)
- **Prayer(All):** Jesus, Son of God, be with us in our moments of trial and darkness. Help us trust in the Father's presence, even when we feel alone. Amen.

**5. "I thirst."** (John 19:28)

- **Leader:** This expresses Jesus' physical suffering, but also His deep spiritual thirst – His longing for the salvation of souls and the fulfillment of the Father's plan. He thirsts for *us*, for our love and our return to God. As you prepare to receive the Eucharist, remember His thirst for communion with you, a thirst He quenches with the life-giving water and blood flowing from His side.
    - **Question:** *Do I recognize Christ's thirst for me? How thirsty am I for Him?* (30 seconds to 1 minute of silence)
- **Prayer(All):** Lord Jesus, You thirsted for our salvation. Fill us with a thirst for You and Your righteousness, that we may drink deeply from the wells of salvation. Amen.

**6. "It is finished."** (John 19:30)

- **Leader:** Jesus declares the completion of His mission. The work the Father gave Him is accomplished. The debt of sin is paid, the Old Covenant finds its fulfillment, the New Covenant is established inviting us in, and the victory over sin and death is won. His obedience unto death demonstrates the ultimate expression of truthful, just, and merciful love. This isn't a cry of defeat, but of triumph. His work makes possible your new life in the Sacraments, a life abiding in Christ.
    - **Question:** *What does Christ's finished work mean for my new life in Him?* (30 seconds to 1 minute of silence)
- **Prayer(All):** Jesus, Victor King, thank You for completing the work of our redemption. May we live always in the victory You have won for us. Amen.

**7. "Father, into your hands I commend my spirit."** (Luke 23:46)

- **Leader:** Jesus' final word is one of perfect trust and surrender to the Father. Having given everything, He places His spirit into the loving hands of His Father. This is the ultimate act of faith and obedience, the model for our own lives. As you approach the Sacraments, you are called to commend your own spirit, your whole life, into God's hands, trusting in His plan and His love.
    - **Question:** *Am I ready to entrust my life completely to the Father, as Jesus did?* (30 seconds to 1 minute of silence))
- **Prayer(All):** Father, into Your hands we commend our spirits. Receive the gift of our lives, made new in Your Son, Jesus Christ. Amen.

**Prayer of the Elect**

*All Elect:* Lord Jesus, standing at the foot of Your Cross, we are humbled by Your sacrifice. Your words pierce our hearts and call us to deeper conversion. As we prepare for the Sacraments of Initiation, we desire to die with You to sin and rise to new life in **Baptism**, to be sealed with Your **Holy Spirit** in **Confirmation**, and to receive Your very self in the **Eucharist**. Wash us clean, clothe us in Your grace, and fill us with Your Spirit. We entrust our lives into Your hands, ready to follow You as members of Your Body, your Kingdom - the Church. Amen.

**Prayer of the Candidates**

*All Candidates:* Lord Jesus, we stand before Your Cross with hearts full of gratitude and anticipation. You have called us to this moment, inviting us into the fullness of faith within Your Church. As we prepare for Confirmation and Eucharist, strengthen our faith, deepen our understanding, and ignite our love. Seal us with Your Holy Spirit and nourish us with Your Body and Blood. Help us to be faithful witnesses to Your love in the world. We commend our journey to You and dedicate our life to service in Your Body, Your Kingdom - the Church. Amen.

**Prayer for the Elect and Candidates**

*Leader:* Let us pray for our Elect and Candidates who are preparing to receive the Sacraments of Initiation.

*All Catechists/Sponsors:* Father, look lovingly upon these chosen ones. As they have journeyed through OCIA and meditated on the passion and death of Your Son, Jesus, deepen their desire for the new life He won for them. Strengthen their resolve to die to sin and rise to grace in the waters of Baptism. Fill them with eager anticipation for the Seal of the Holy Spirit in Confirmation and the nourishment of the Eucharist. May their hearts burn with love for You and their neighbor as they prepare to join us fully at the table of Your Son. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.

**Concluding Prayer**

*Leader:* Lord Jesus, Your final words from the Cross are a testament to Your infinite love, mercy, and sacrifice. You have shown us the path of forgiveness, the promise of hope, the gift of family, solidarity in suffering, Your thirst for our souls, the triumph of Your completed work, and the peace of surrender to the Father. As the elect prepare to die and rise with You in Baptism, and all who will be sealed with Your Spirit in Confirmation, and to receive Your very life in the Eucharist at the Easter Vigil, fill them with humble awe, gratitude and Your love. May Your Seven Last Words echo in their hearts, guiding them into the fullness of life-giving communion You offer. We ask this in Your holy name. Amen.

**Final Blessing**

*Leader:* May the Lord bless you and keep you. May He let His face shine upon you and be gracious to you. May He look upon you kindly and give you His peace. And may Almighty God bless you all, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

*All:* Amen.
