# Chapter 14: Answering the Call: Sainthood and Sharing the Good News

[Author Anecdote: Share a feeling of inadequacy about the call to sainthood or evangelization, or conversely, a story about being inspired by the simple, loving witness of an 'ordinary' holy person. Maybe start with something like: "If you'd told me years ago that *I* was called to be a saint, I probably would have laughed... Saints felt like distant figures in stained glass, not ordinary people like me. But then I encountered someone whose simple, consistent love, lived out in the messy reality of daily life, radiated something undeniably attractive, something holy. It wasn't flashy, but it was real, and it changed my perspective entirely."]

We've journeyed together, exploring the depths of authentic love – what it is, how it's grounded in truth, justice, and mercy, and how we live it out through God's Commandments, the power of virtue, the lifeblood of the Sacraments, the intimacy of prayer, and the foundational love of family. But where does this path ultimately lead? Is the goal simply to become a "better person," find some inner peace, and call it a day? Absolutely not! The Catholic faith, in its radical beauty, calls us to something far more profound, something breathtaking: **Sainthood**. And woven into the very fabric of this call is the urgent mission to share the source of this life-altering love – the Good News of Jesus Christ – with every single person we encounter.

## 1. The Universal Call to Holiness (Yes, YOU!)

Forget the idea that saints are just dusty statues or figures confined to history books. Forget the notion that holiness is reserved for a spiritual elite – priests, nuns, monks, or mystics living apart from the world. The Second Vatican Council declared it with resounding clarity, and the Catechism echoes it:

> "All Christians in any state or walk of life are called to the fullness of Christian life and to the perfection of charity." (CCC 2013, quoting Lumen Gentium 40)

This isn't just a nice sentiment; it's a core truth of our faith. It's a direct command from Jesus Himself: "Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect" (Matthew 5:48). It’s a call echoed by St. Peter: "As he who called you is holy, be holy yourselves in all your conduct" (1 Peter 1:15-16).

This call to perfection, to holiness, might sound intimidating, even impossible. Who among us feels "perfect"? But this isn't about achieving some kind of flawless human record through sheer willpower. It's about surrender. It's about opening ourselves completely to God's transforming grace, allowing Him to chip away at our imperfections, heal our wounds, and mold us, day by day, more perfectly into the image of His Son. Sainthood is the vocation of *every single baptized Christian*. It's your vocation. It's my vocation. It's *our* shared destiny in Christ.

## 2. What Does It Mean to Be a Saint? (Perfection of Love)

So, what does this "holiness" or "perfection" actually look like? It's not about mystical phenomena or extraordinary feats (though God can certainly grant those). At its heart, **sainthood is the perfection of charity – the perfection of love.**

It means reaching that point where we truly love God with our *whole* heart, *whole* soul, *whole* mind, and *whole* strength. And flowing directly from that, it means loving our neighbor as ourselves, not just out of duty, but *for the love of God*. It's about living out, consistently and vibrantly, that integrated love we've been exploring throughout this book – a love grounded in truth, expressed in justice, and overflowing with mercy, all empowered and sustained by supernatural faith, unwavering hope, and the steady practice of virtue.

Being a saint isn't about achieving a state of emotionless tranquility or escaping the struggles of human life. It's about allowing God's grace to so fully permeate every corner of our being – our thoughts, words, actions, desires, relationships – that we become transparent reflections of Christ's own love to the world. Saints are those who, through surrender and cooperation with grace, let God love through them.

## 3. Holiness and Mission: Two Sides of One Coin

This personal call to holiness isn't meant to be lived in isolation. It's intrinsically, inseparably linked to our participation in the mission of the Church – the mission to share the Good News. Think of it as two sides of the same coin. As the Catechism puts it:

> "The ultimate purpose of mission is none other than to make men share in the communion between the Father and the Son in their Spirit of love." (CCC 850)

Our personal growth in holiness *fuels* our mission. The more we allow God's love to fill us, purify us, and transform us, the more we naturally, almost inevitably, desire to share that love with others. You can't contain a fire like that! Authentic Christian witness doesn't come from perfectly memorized arguments or clever techniques; it flows from a heart genuinely burning with love for God and neighbor. People are drawn to Christ not primarily by our words, but by seeing His love authentically lived out in us, even amidst our imperfections.

Conversely, actively engaging in the Church's mission pushes us towards greater holiness. When we step out in faith to share the Gospel, whether through actions or words, we quickly realize our own inadequacy. We're forced to rely more deeply on God's grace, to pray more earnestly, to confront our own sins and failings, and to strive to live more consistently with the message we proclaim. Holiness fuels mission, and mission fuels holiness. They grow together.

## 4. The Great Commission: Sharing the Good News

This mission isn't something we invented; it comes directly from Christ Himself. His final words to His apostles before ascending into heaven were not suggestions, but a clear command, a mandate given to the entire Church, and therefore to each of us according to our state in life and opportunities:

"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you" (Matthew 28:19-20). And again, "Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation" (Mark 16:15).

This is the Great Commission. It's not optional for the Church, and it's not optional for us as members of His Body. But what exactly is this "gospel," this "Good News" we are called to proclaim? It's the incredible story we've been unpacking throughout this book! It's the news that God, who *is* Love, loved us so much He sent His only Son. It's the news of Jesus Christ – His life, death, and resurrection. It's the news of His victory over sin and death, the offer of radical forgiveness, healing, and a completely new life in Him. It's the invitation into communion with the Most Holy Trinity. It's the revelation of what authentic, integrated love – a love of truth, justice, and mercy – truly looks like and the promise that, by His grace, we can live it. It's the best news the world has ever heard, and we have the privilege and responsibility of sharing it.

## 5. How Do We Evangelize? (Witness, Words, Works)

Okay, so we're called to be saints, and we're called to share the Good News. But *how*? Does it mean we all need to become street preachers or theologians? Not necessarily. The Church teaches that evangelization happens in diverse ways, particularly for lay people living "in the ordinary circumstances of the world":

> "Lay people also fulfill their prophetic mission by evangelization, 'that is, the proclamation of Christ by word and the testimony of life.' For lay people, 'this evangelization ... acquires a specific property and peculiar efficacy because it is accomplished in the ordinary circumstances of the world.'" (CCC 905, quoting Lumen Gentium 35)

We can break this down into three key areas:

*   **Witness of Life:** This is often the most powerful and foundational form of evangelization. It means living our Catholic faith authentically, joyfully, and consistently in our everyday lives – in our families, workplaces, schools, neighborhoods, and online interactions. It's about letting people *see* the difference Christ makes. Do we handle stress with prayer? Do we forgive readily? Do we speak truthfully and act justly? Do we show compassion, especially to the difficult or marginalized? Do we possess a sense of peace and hope even amidst trials? When people see the integrated love of Christ genuinely lived out, it raises questions and opens hearts in a way arguments rarely can.
*   **Explicit Proclamation (Words):** While witness is crucial, sometimes words are necessary. St. Peter tells us to be ready "always to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you," but crucially adds we should do so "with gentleness and respect" (1 Peter 3:15). This isn't about winning debates, but about lovingly sharing the truth. It might involve sharing our personal testimony of how Christ has worked in our lives, gently correcting a misunderstanding about the faith, explaining a basic teaching, inviting someone to Mass or a parish event, or simply offering a word of encouragement rooted in faith. It requires knowing our faith, but even more, knowing the Person of Jesus Christ.
*   **Works of Mercy & Justice:** Actions speak volumes. Serving others, especially the poor, the sick, the lonely, and the vulnerable, is a powerful way to demonstrate God's love in a tangible way. When we feed the hungry, clothe the naked, visit the imprisoned, comfort the sorrowful, or work for justice in our communities *because* of our love for Christ, our actions become a form of proclamation. These works of mercy and justice authenticate our words and show the world that Christian love isn't just an idea, but a transformative force. Love backs up our words and makes the Gospel credible.

## 6. Overcoming Fear

Let's be honest: the idea of sharing our faith can be terrifying. What if people reject us? What if they ridicule our beliefs? What if we don't know enough to answer their questions? What if we offend someone? These fears are real, common, and understandable.

The first thing to remember is *who* is actually doing the converting. It's not us! Jesus promised His apostles, "You will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses" (Acts 1:8). It is the Holy Spirit who convicts hearts, opens minds, and draws people to faith. Our job is simply to be faithful witnesses, to plant seeds, to water them with prayer and love, and to trust God with the results. We are collaborators with the Spirit, not the sole actors.

Secondly, focus on building genuine relationships. Evangelization is rarely effective as a cold transaction. It flows best from authentic friendships and loving concern for the other person. Share out of love, not obligation or a desire to "win."

Thirdly, pray! Pray for courage, for wisdom, for humility, and for opportunities. Ask the Holy Spirit to show you who He wants you to reach out to and how. Start small. Maybe it's just offering to pray for a struggling coworker, or sharing how your faith helps you through a tough time.

Finally, trust in the power and attractiveness of God's love. Deep down, every human heart is searching for the truth, meaning, and love that only He can provide, even if they don't consciously realize it. Don't underestimate the hunger in people's souls or the power of the Gospel to meet that hunger.

## 7. The Joy of the Gospel

Sharing our faith shouldn't feel like a heavy burden or another item on our spiritual checklist. When we truly grasp the immensity of the gift we've received – the gift of God's unconditional love, forgiveness, and the promise of eternal life – sharing it becomes a natural overflow of gratitude and joy.

There is an incredible, profound joy in seeing someone come to know the love of Jesus Christ, perhaps through a seed *we* planted or watered. Participating, even in small ways, in God's great work of salvation gives our lives a depth of meaning and purpose that nothing else can offer. It connects our small lives to His grand, eternal plan.

Ultimately, the desire to share the Good News flows from the overwhelming realization of how much we ourselves have been loved, forgiven, and transformed by God. It's not about us being perfect messengers, but about pointing others to the perfect Savior who loves them infinitely more than we ever could. Answering the call to share the faith isn't a duty; it's an invitation to participate in the greatest adventure and the deepest joy imaginable.

> **Chapter Takeaway:** Every Catholic is called to the perfection of love (sainthood), and this call includes sharing the Good News of God's transformative love with others through the witness of our lives, our words, and our actions.

**For Reflection and Discussion:**

1.  Does the idea of being called to be a "saint" feel inspiring or intimidating? Why? How does understanding sainthood as the "perfection of charity" make it seem more attainable?
2.  Think of a time someone's authentic Christian witness (through their actions or words) had a positive impact on you. What made it effective?
3.  What are your biggest fears or hesitations when it comes to sharing your faith with others? How can you rely on the Holy Spirit to overcome these fears?
4.  Considering your current state in life (job, family, community involvement), what is one practical way you could better fulfill the Great Commission this week – either through witness of life, gentle words, or a specific act of charity done in Christ's name?

**Practice & Habit:**

*   **Pray for Holiness:** Explicitly ask God each day this week for the grace to grow in holiness, to love Him and neighbor more perfectly.
*   **Identify an Opportunity:** Prayerfully identify one person in your life who may not know Christ's love fully. Commit to praying for them daily this week and look for one natural opportunity to show them kindness or offer a gentle word of hope rooted in your faith.
