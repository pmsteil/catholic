# **Catholicism 101: A Brief Overview of the Catholic Faith**

We are in great debt to the "woke" movement.  It has taught us a great deal about the temptation
of the human heart to cave in on itself - to wallow in "self".  To search for ways to elevate "me"
above all others.  In the hierarchy of "intersectionality" and "oppression olympics" the desire is to
take any form of human suffering and to use it as a weapon to elevate oneself above others.  One problem:
It does not reduce human suffering, it only causes more.  It does not call people to learn from their
suffering, to grow from it or become stronger.  It only calls people to wallow in it, to use it as a weapon
and to signal a "false virtue" to the world.  It makes the person dependent on their suffering.  If there
is no suffering, marginilization, or oppression, then the person loses their sense of meaning, value and
purpose.  Also this movement causes one to deny the natural and moral law in pursuit of a false
"social justice".  "Social justice" if defined as justice decided upon by the mob, is not justice at all,
it is revenge, resentment and devolves into hate of our neighbor.  If justice is not based on something
firm, it will always devolve into whatever the mob decides is "just" at the time.  But beware, the mob
will eventually turn on itself.

The Catholic (Christian Faith properly handed down from Jesus) teaches something quite different and
exactly the opposite.  It teaches that suffering is a part of life.  It is a part of the human condition.
It is not something to be avoided at all costs, but something to be embraced or at least accepted.  It
teaches us also to look within to determine if WE are the CAUSE of our own or the suffering of others.
It teaches us that as human beings, that natural and moral law that is written on our hearts, is something
given to us by our Creator.  All human beings are created this way and so it is a core, fundamental TRUTH
of what it means to be a human being.  We would say, this part of the God revealing Himself to us.  And
so we have the fundamental Truth that all human beings are created in the image and likeness of God.  This
is the basis for the dignity of the human person.  This is the basis for the respect, honor and love that
we are to live out in our lives.

The Catholic Faith teaches us not to look within, but to look at our Creator for our sense of meaning, value
purpose and for what the Truth of what is right and wrong.  So we ground "justice" in these moral truths
that have been revealed to us and those we can know through logic and reason - and even science.  If God
is the Creator of the Universe, then all Truths are also His creation and all Truths will point back to Him.

The Catholic Faith teaches us that the place to find our deepest sense of meaning, value and purpose is
to be obedient to Jesus when he tell us the MOST IMPORTANT COMMANDMENT:  Love the Lord your God with all your
heart, soul, mind and strength. It is no accident that the FIRST of the Ten Commmandments also
teaches the same:

> ## Exodus 20:1-6
>
> And God spoke all these words:
>
> “I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
>
> “You shall have no other gods before[a] me.
>
> “You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or> in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments."

In other words, we worship no idols, but instead the True God who wants to bring us out of the bondage of
slavery and into abundant life.

> ## John 10:10
>
> A thief comes only to steal and slaughter and destroy; I came so that they might have life and have it more abundantly.

The Catholic Faith teaches us not to look inward, but to look upward to God for our sense of meaning, value,
purpose, morality, justice, and the definition of love itself.  To love is to humbly submit our will to the
will of God in doing what is right and just for our neighbor.  This is why Jesus teaches that the love of
neighbor is the second most important commandment and like the first:

> ## Matthew 22:39-40
>
> The second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments.

This is second because by submitting our will to God, body, mind and soul - we learn what love is.  What
morality is, what is justice, mercy, forgiveness, and properly how to love our family, friends - our
neighbor.

The Catholic Faith teaches us that the greatest love we can have for our neighbor is to follow Jesus'
teaching on this:

> ## John 15:13
>
> No one has greater love than this, to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.

This is the ultimate act of love.  To be willing to humbly and obediently submit our entire will,
body, mind and soul to God that we would be willing to sacrifice our own life for our family, friends, community and even nation and especially for God and for the Truth.

This is WHY all humans recognize and honor the "hero".  The hero is the one who is willing to sacrifice
their own life for the good of others.  The soldier who signs away his life the moment he signs up to
defend his country.  The police officer who puts his life on the line every day to protect his community.
The fireman who runs into a burning building to save a child.  The mother who sacrifices her own
comfort, time, energy, and even her own life to bring a child into the world and to raise that child
to be a good, moral, and just human being.  The father who is willing to sacrifice his own life to
protect his family.

You might say - "well, this is Christianity and not specifically Catholicism.  I can find these teachings
in Protestant denominations and even other religions."  There is some truth to that, as there are some
kernals of truth to be found in all religions and man made philosophies.

But the Catholic Faith takes seriously its job to hand down these Truths in tact for each generation.
It was given this job and the authority to do so by Jesus himself:

> ## Matthew 28:18-20
>
> Then Jesus approached and said to them, “All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, until the end of the age.

Most focus on the charge to "make disciples of all nations", but note that Jesus gave His Authority to
the Disciples to do this, so that they could do it all in His Name. They don't go out in the name of
Paul or Peter or John, but in the Name of Jesus.  The Church is Holy because Jesus gave it His Authority
to hand down the faith - this handing down is what the Church refers to as Sacred Tradition.

And these disciples took this charge seriously and did just that.  They sacrified their lives to hand down the teachings of Jesus to the second generation.  Most literally were persecuted and killed for doing so (the very first martyrs).

The Apostles work was not done to make disciples of all nations, so they instituted Bishops to take their place and to hand down the teachings of Jesus to the third generation.  And so on and so on.  This is the Apostolic Succession.  This is the handing down of the teachings of Jesus in tact.

So our job today as the Church is not to try and figure out what the Bible means, but to learn the Faith
from the countless Saints, Doctors of the Church, and the Magisterium of the Church and then hand it down
to the next generation.

The Catholic Faith is calling you to learn to live a life of humble, obedient, worship of our Lord
so that you can learn how to be willing to be a hero in sacrifice for your family, friends, community,
nation and especially for God and for the Truth.

So, to be a Christian doesn't just mean to "love everyone" or to "be nice" or to "be inclusive" or that
"love is love". It means submitting our will to the authority of Jesus as we find it in His Church,
the Catholic Church.  And when we do this, we will learn how to be a hero. How to love like Jesus
did.  To be willing to love so deeply that we want what is the ultimate good for our family and friends
and even our enemies.  And yes to be willing to sacrifice even our own lives for what is good.

So the answer to human suffering is not in "woke" ideology, but in the teachings of Jesus as have
been handed down to us in the Catholic Faith.  The answer to human suffering is to be the very
best human being you can be.  To be a hero, to stand up to evil, oppression, and injustice but
with God's obedience, justice, mercy, forgiveness - HIS love.

When we do this, the Kingdom of God truly is at hand.

## Introduction: Why Catholicism?

All the social problems we face today are rooted in spiritual problems of the human heart and based in the rejection of God's love and truth.

- **Historical Roots:**
  - Founded by Jesus Christ in the 1st century.
  - Apostolic succession from the original twelve apostles.
  - Rich tradition of saints, theologians, and martyrs.
  - Historical continuity with the early Church.
  - **Matthew 16:18:** "And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it."
  - **Matthew 28:18-20:** "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you."
  - Truth:
    - In today's world, where relativism and subjectivism are prevalent, the Catholic Church offers objective truth and moral guidance.
    - **John 14:6:** "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."
    - **1 Timothy 3:15:** "If I am delayed, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth."
    - **John 8:32:** "You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."
    - **John 17:17:** "Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth."

### What is Religion?

Etymologically, the word "religion" comes from the Latin word "religio," which means "to bind together." Religion binds us to God, to one another, and to the world around us.
- **Religion:** A relationship with the divine, expressed through beliefs, practices, and moral values.
- **Purpose of Religion:**
  - To seek the truth about the ultimate meaning and purpose of life.
  - To establish a relationship with the divine.
  - To guide moral behavior and promote human flourishing

### What do we mean by "God"?

- **Proofs for the Existence of God (St. Thomas Aquinas' Five Ways)**

    1. **The Argument from Motion:**
        Everything that moves is moved by another; this leads to a First Mover, which is God.
    2. **The Argument from Causation:**
        Every effect has a cause; this leads to a First Cause, which is God.
    3. **The Argument from Contingency:**
        Things exist contingently and could fail to exist; this leads to a Necessary Being, which is God.
    4. **The Argument from Degree:**
        There are varying degrees of perfection in beings; this leads to a Perfect Being, which is God.
    5. **The Argument from Design:**
        The order and purpose observed in nature imply a Designer, which is God.

For, in the name of God, the Father and Lord of the universe, and of our Savior Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit, they then receive the washing with water."
  2. **St. Cyril of Jerusalem (313–386 AD):** "Since man is of a twofold nature, composed of body and soul, the purification also is twofold: the one incorporeal for the incorporeal part, and the other bodily for the body; the water cleanses the body, and the Spirit seals the soul."

  1. **St. Ignatius of Antioch (c. 35–c. 107 AD):** "Take note of those who hold heterodox opinions on the grace of Jesus Christ which has come to us, and see how contrary their opinions are to the mind of God...
