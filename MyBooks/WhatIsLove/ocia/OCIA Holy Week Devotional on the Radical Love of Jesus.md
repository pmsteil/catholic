# Jesus Teaches Radical Love: A Devotional for Holy Week

## Introduction

My dearest elect and candidates as you prepare to enter fully into the Catholic Church this Easter Vigil, take this Holy Week to sit at the feet of the Master Himself. Listen carefully to Jesus as He reveals the profound, demanding, and transformative nature of the radical love He embodies and calls us to embrace. This love is the heart of the Kingdom of God—the family you are about to join in fullness. Open your hearts as He Himself defines this love and issues His great commandment.

## Jesus Teaches: The New Commandment

**John 13:34-35** (The New Commandment)

Jesus said:

> "A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”

_Jesus Teaches:_ Jesus issues a "new commandment." The newness lies not in the call to love, but in the standard: love _as I have loved you_. This specific, sacrificial, servant-hearted love is to be the defining characteristic and identifying mark of His disciples to the world.

_Reflection:_ Jesus commands me to love others _as He has loved me_. How does His sacrificial, servant love challenge my own way of loving within my family, among my friends, and toward fellow believers? How can this specific love be a more visible sign to the world that I am His disciple?

## Jesus Teaches: The Foundation - Love God and Neighbor

**Luke 10:25-37** (What will save the World and the Good Samaritan)

> Just then a lawyer stood up to test Jesus. "Teacher," he said, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?" Jesus said to him, "What is written in the law? What do you read there?" He answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself." And Jesus said to him, "You have given the right answer; do this, and you will live."
>
> But wanting to justify himself, he asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?" Jesus replied, "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell into the hands of robbers, who stripped him, beat him, and went away, leaving him half dead. Now by chance a priest was going down that road; and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan while traveling came near him; and when he saw him, he was moved with pity. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, having poured oil and wine on them. Then he put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. The next day he took out two denarii, gave them to the innkeeper, and said, 'Take care of him; and when I come back, I will repay you whatever more you spend.' Which of these three, do you think, was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers?" He said, "The one who showed him mercy." Jesus said to him, "Go and do likewise."

_Jesus Teaches:_ Jesus affirms that the path to eternal life - healing/salvation from our sins both now and eternally - lies in loving God completely and loving our neighbor as ourselves. When asked to define "neighbor," He tells the parable of the Good Samaritan, teaching that love must translate into active mercy and compassion, extending even beyond social and religious boundaries. Love is shown by _doing_.

_Reflection:_ Jesus teaches that love requires action ("Go and do likewise"). Thinking of my family, friends, coworkers, and community, who is the "neighbor" in my life right now that needs me to show mercy and compassion in a concrete way, perhaps even when it's difficult or inconvenient?

## Jesus Teaches: An Invitation to His Restful Love

**Matthew 11:28-30** (Come to Me)

Jesus said:

> "Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”

_Jesus Teaches:_ Amidst the demands of discipleship, Jesus offers a profound invitation rooted in His own gentle and humble love. He calls those burdened by life or religious legalism to find true soul-rest in Him, not through inaction, but by embracing His "easy yoke" – a life lived in trusting relationship and obedience to Him, which is liberating compared to the crushing weight of sin or self-reliance.

_Reflection:_ Jesus invites me to find rest in His gentle and humble heart. What burdens am I carrying that I need to entrust to Him? How can I better learn from His humility and embrace His "easy yoke" in my daily life?

## Jesus Teaches: The Radical Demands of Love

**Matthew 5:38-48** (Sermon on the Mount)

Jesus said:

> "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' But I say to you, Do not resist an evildoer. But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also; and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat, give your cloak as well; and if anyone forces you to go one mile, go also the second mile. Give to everyone who begs from you, and do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you. You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be children of your Father in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers and sisters, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect."

_Jesus Teaches:_ Jesus radically redefines love, pushing beyond simple justice ("eye for an eye") and tribal affection. He commands us to love without limits – non-resistance to evil, sacrificial generosity beyond measure, and even love for enemies and persecutors. This reflects the perfect, universal mercy/love of our Heavenly Father.

_Reflection:_ Jesus calls for love that goes beyond reciprocity, even loving enemies. Where in my life am I holding back love, perhaps only loving those who love me back? How can I strive for the Father's perfect, universal mercy/love?

## Jesus Teaches: Love Means Sacrifice and Obedience

**John 13:1-17** (Washing the Disciples' Feet)

Jesus said (Narrative):

> Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. During supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him, Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going back to God, rose from supper. He laid aside his outer garments, and taking a towel, tied it around his waist. Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him. He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?” Jesus answered him, “What I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand.” Peter said to him, “You shall never wash my feet.” Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.” Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!” Jesus said to him, “The one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not every one of you.” For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, “Not all of you are clean.”
>
> When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, “Do you understand what I have done to you? You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you. Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.”

_Jesus Teaches:_ On the night before His death, knowing His hour had come, Jesus demonstrated the depth of His love through profound humility. By washing His disciples' feet—a task reserved for the lowest servant—He modeled servant leadership and showed that His love translates into selfless action. He gives this act as an example, commanding His followers to love and serve one another with the same humility.

_Reflection:_ Jesus, the Lord and Teacher, washed His disciples' feet as an example of loving service. How can I follow His example by humbly serving my family, friends, and others in my daily life, putting their needs before my own, even in ways that seem lowly or inconvenient?

**John 15:1-17** (The Vine and the Branches)

Jesus said:

> "I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned. If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples. As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you. Abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full. This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you. No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. These things I command you, so that you will love one another."

_Jesus Teaches:_ Jesus uses the image of the vine and branches to illustrate our vital connection to Him. He is the source of life ("the true vine"), and we ("the branches") can only bear fruit (live a life of love and good works) if we remain intimately connected ("abide") in Him. Abiding involves keeping His commandments, especially loving one another sacrificially, mirroring the Father's love for Him and His love for us. This connection elevates us to friendship with Him and allows His joy to be in us. Apart from Him, we can do nothing of eternal value.

_Reflection:_ Jesus emphasizes that abiding in Him is essential for bearing fruit (love) and experiencing His joy. How am I actively cultivating my connection to Jesus, the True Vine? Am I obeying His command to love my family, friends, and fellow believers sacrificially, recognizing that this is proof of discipleship and friendship with Him?

**Mark 8:34-38** (The Cost of Discipleship)

Jesus said:

> "If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake, and for the sake of the gospel, will save it. For what will it profit them to gain the whole world and forfeit their life? Indeed, what can they give in return for their life? Those who are ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of them the Son of Man will also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."

_Jesus Teaches:_ Jesus makes it clear that following Him in love requires total commitment: denying our own desires, embracing suffering ("take up their cross"), and prioritizing His kingdom and the Gospel above our own earthly lives and worldly possessions. True life is found in losing it for His sake.

_Reflection:_ Following Jesus means denying self and taking up the cross. What "self" do I need to deny, or what cross (suffering to do His Will) do I need to embrace more fully, to follow Jesus more closely in love?

## Jesus Teaches: Love in Action – Mercy and Justice

**Matthew 25:31-46** (The Last Judgment)

Jesus said:

> "When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats... Then the king will say to those at his right hand, 'Come, you that are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you gave me clothing, I was sick and you took care of me, I was in prison and you visited me.' Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when was it that we saw you hungry and gave you food, or thirsty and gave you something to drink?...' And the king will answer them, 'Truly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me.'... Then he will say to those at his left hand, 'You that are accursed, depart from me into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels; for I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink...' And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."

_Jesus Teaches:_ Jesus identifies Himself with the needy – the hungry, thirsty, stranger, naked, sick, and imprisoned. He reveals that our eternal destiny hinges on whether we showed love through concrete acts of mercy and justice towards "the least of these," as serving them is serving Him directly.

_Reflection:_ Jesus identifies with the "least of these." How am I actively serving the hungry, thirsty, stranger, naked, sick, or imprisoned in my community or the wider world? How can I see Christ more clearly in them?

**Luke 15:11-32** (Parable of the Prodigal Son)

Jesus said:

> "'There was a man who had two sons. The younger of them said to his father, "Father, give me the share of the property that will belong to me." So he divided his property between them... \[The son\] squandered his property in dissolute living... But when he came to himself he said... "I will get up and go to my father, and I will say to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me like one of your hired hands.'" So he set off and went to his father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion; he ran and put his arms around him and kissed him... But the father said to his slaves, "Quickly, bring out a robe—the best one—and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. And get the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate; for this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!"'"

_Jesus Teaches:_ Through this powerful parable, Jesus illustrates the boundless, compassionate, and celebratory nature of the Father's merciful (full of mercy) love. He shows us a God who eagerly awaits the return of the sinner, runs to embrace us, restores our dignity, and rejoices over our repentance. This is the merciful love at the heart of the Kingdom.

_Reflection:_ The Father's love is merciful and celebratory. Do I truly believe in this boundless mercy for myself? How can I better reflect this compassionate love to those who have strayed?

## Jesus Teaches: Love Requires Forgiveness

**Matthew 18:21-35** (Parable of the Unforgiving Servant)

> Then Peter came and said to him, "Lord, if another member of the church sins against me, how often should I forgive? As many as seven times?" Jesus said to him, "Not seven times, but, I tell you, seventy-seven times. For this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves... And out of pity for him, the lord of that slave released him and forgave him the debt... Then his lord summoned him and said to him, 'You wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. Should you not have had mercy on your fellow slave, as I had mercy on you?' And in anger his lord handed him over to be tortured until he would pay his entire debt. So my heavenly Father will also do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother or sister from your heart."

_Jesus Teaches:_ Jesus responds to Peter's question about forgiveness with a call for _limitless_ mercy, symbolized by "seventy-seven times." He uses a stark parable to warn that if we, having received God's immense forgiveness, refuse to forgive others from the heart, we risk forfeiting God's mercy ourselves. Radical love requires radical forgiveness.

_Reflection:_ Radical love requires radical forgiveness, especially towards those closest to us. Is there a family member, friend, or fellow believer I need to forgive "from the heart," letting go of my pain or resentment as I recall the immense forgiveness I have received from God?

## Jesus Teaches: The Bread of Life - Radical Dependence and Belief

**John 6:26-69** (The Bread of Life Discourse)

Jesus said:

> 26 Jesus answered them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you are seeking me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves. 27 Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For on him God the Father has set his seal.” 28 Then they said to him, “What must we do, to be doing the works of God?” 29 Jesus answered them, “This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.” 30 So they said to him, “Then what sign do you do, that we may see and believe you? What work do you perform? 31 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’” 32 Jesus then said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven. 33 For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.” 34 They said to him, “Sir, give us this bread always.”
>
> 35 Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst. 36 But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe. 37 All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out. 38 For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me. 39 And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day. 40 For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.”
>
> 41 So the Jews grumbled about him, because he said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven.” 42 They said, “Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?” 43 Jesus answered them, “Do not grumble among yourselves. 44 No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day. 45 It is written in the Prophets, ‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me— 46 not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God; he has seen the Father. 47 Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life. 48 I am the bread of life. 49 Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. 50 This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die. 51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”
>
> 52 The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” 53 So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. 54 Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. 55 For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. 56 Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him. 57 As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever feeds on me, he also will live because of me. 58 This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like the bread the fathers ate, and died. Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.” 59 Jesus said these things in the synagogue, as he taught at Capernaum.
>
> 60 When many of his disciples heard it, they said, “This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?” 61 But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about it, said to them, “Do you take offense at this? 62 Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? 63 It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is no help at all. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. 64 But there are some of you who do not believe.” (For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him.) 65 And he said, “This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.”
>
> 66 After this many of his disciples turned back and no longer walked with him. 67 So Jesus said to the Twelve, “Do you want to go away as well?” 68 Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life, 69 and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.”

_Jesus Teaches:_ Jesus reveals Himself as the "Bread of Life," the true sustenance from Heaven that gives eternal life, far surpassing the manna. He emphasizes belief in Him as the essential "work of God." He then makes the radical claim that His flesh is true food and His blood true drink, necessary for eternal life and abiding in Him. This points directly to the Eucharist, His desire for a complete physical and spiritual Communion with us, uniting us intimately in His Love. This teaching is difficult, causing many to turn away, but Peter professes faith, recognizing Jesus alone has the words of eternal life. This discourse highlights the necessity of faith, the profound reality of the Eucharist, and our total dependence on Jesus for spiritual life and His mercy.

_Reflection:_ Jesus calls Himself the Bread of Life and says we must "eat His flesh and drink His blood" for eternal life, desiring complete Communion with us. How does this teaching challenge my understanding of faith and my participation in the Mass? Am I approaching the Eucharistic table with true justice in my heart and actions, ready to receive His true mercy and be united fully in His Love? Am I willing to accept this "hard saying" like Peter, even when it's difficult to grasp?

## Jesus Teaches: Love Creates Unity

**John 17:17-26** (Jesus Prays for His Disciples and Future Believers)

Jesus prayed:

> "Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth. As you sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world. And for their sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth. I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through their word, that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you sent me. The glory that you have given me I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one, I in them and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you loved me. Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am, to see my glory that you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world. O righteous Father, even though the world does not know you, I know you, and these know that you have sent me. I made known to them your name, and I will continue to make it known, that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.”

_Jesus Prays:_ In this intimate prayer, Jesus first prays for His disciples to be sanctified (made holy) in the truth of God's word, consecrating Himself for this purpose. He then extends His prayer to all future believers, asking for perfect unity among us, mirroring the unity between Him and the Father. This unity, rooted in the divine love and glory shared within the Trinity and given to us, is meant to be a powerful witness to the world, demonstrating that the Father sent Jesus and loves us as He loves His Son. He desires for us to be with Him eternally, sharing in His glory and filled with the very love the Father has for the Son.

_Reflection:_ Jesus prayed for our sanctification in truth and our perfect unity, rooted in divine love, as a witness to the world. How am I pursuing holiness through God's word? How can I actively contribute to the unity of the Church, reflecting the love of the Trinity in my relationships with fellow believers, so the world may know God's love?

## Final Reflection

As you prepare to enter fully into the Catholic Church, consider the words of Jesus you have encountered in this devotional.

In what specific areas of your life do you feel Jesus inviting you, through His teachings, to a more radical love? Consider your relationships with family and friends: where is He calling you to greater fidelity, deeper commitment, more generous mercy, complete self-surrender, or fuller obedience? How might responding to this invitation transform your life, your relationships, and contribute to building God's kingdom?
