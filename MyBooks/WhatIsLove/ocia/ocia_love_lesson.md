# RCIA Lesson: The Theological Virtue of Love

## Scripture for Opening Reflection

> "Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God; everyone who loves is begotten by God and knows God. Whoever is without love does not know God, for God is love. In this way the love of God was revealed to us: God sent his only Son into the world so that we might have life through him. In this, love is not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as expiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also must love one another. No one has ever seen God. Yet, if we love one another, God remains in us, and his love is brought to perfection in us." (1 John 4:7-12, NABRE)

## Introduction (10 minutes)

In today's world, we hear the word "love" constantly—in songs, movies, advertisements, and social media. Yet despite this cultural obsession with love, we see a society struggling with division, isolation, and a deep hunger for authentic connection. As Catholics, we believe that this hunger points to our fundamental need for God, who is Love itself.

The Bible establishes the three theological virtues of faith, hope, and love as we see in 1 Corinthians 13.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church reminds us of the centrality of love in our faith:

> **CCC 1822**: "Charity is the theological virtue by which we love God above all things for his own sake, and our neighbor as ourselves for the love of God."

> "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and love your neighbor as yourself." (Matthew 22:37-39, NABRE)

And the Bible makes LOVE a CONDITION of Salvation in these verses:

- Luke 10:25-37
- 1 John 4:7-12

Today, we'll explore the theological virtue of love—not as the world understands it, but as God reveals it through Scripture, Tradition, and the teachings of the Church.

### Small Group Discussion

**Question:** "Why is our LOVE of God and Neighbor a REQUIREMENT for Salvation?"=

Each group to come up with an answer to relay to the larger group.





## Part 1: What is Love? (15 minutes)

### Scripture Reading

> "If I speak in human and angelic tongues but do not have love, I am a resounding gong or a clashing cymbal. And if I have the gift of prophecy and comprehend all mysteries and all knowledge; if I have all faith so as to move mountains but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give away everything I own, and if I hand my body over so that I may boast but do not have love, I gain nothing." (1 Corinthians 13:1-3, NABRE)

### The World's Definition vs. God's Definition

Ask participants: "How does our culture define love? What messages about love do we receive from media, entertainment, and society?"
*(Allow for discussion)*

- What is Love? Baby don't hurt me... don't hurt me... no more
- Love is a battlefield
- Love stinks - yah, yah
- All you need is love...
- I just called to say I love you...
- Love means never having to say you're sorry...
- You complete me...
- Love at first site...
- Better to beg forgiveness than to ask permission
- LOVE IS LOVE!


### Small Group Question

The Catholic understanding of love goes much deeper than feelings or attraction. In 1 John 4:8, we read that "God is love." This profound statement reveals that love is not merely something God does—it's who God is.

> **CCC 1822**: "Charity is the theological virtue by which we love God above all things for his own sake, and our neighbor as ourselves for the love of God."

> **CCC 1823**: "Jesus makes charity the new commandment. By loving his own 'to the end,' he makes manifest the Father's love which he receives. By loving one another, the disciples imitate the love of Jesus which they themselves receive. Whence Jesus says: 'As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you; abide in my love.'"

The Catholic definition of love can be understood as:

> "Perfect love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant-binding truth, justice, and mercy into life-giving communion."

Let's break this down:

- **Sacred**: Love originates from God and participates in His divine nature
- **Sacrificial**: True love always involves self-gift and sacrifice
- **Covenant-binding**: Love creates lasting bonds of commitment
- **Truth, justice, and mercy in unity**: These three elements must work together
- **Life-giving communion**: Love creates authentic relationship and new life

> **CCC 1825**: "Christ died out of love for us, while we were still 'enemies.' The Lord asks us to love as he does, even our enemies, to make ourselves the neighbor of those farthest away, and to love children and the poor as Christ himself."

### Small Group Question

**Question:** "How has our culture's definition of love influenced your own understanding of love throughout your life? What aspects of the Catholic definition of love as 'sacred, sacrificial, covenant-binding truth, justice, and mercy into life-giving communion' challenge you most deeply and why?"

## Part 2: The Three Elements of Love (20 minutes)

### Truth

> "Jesus then said to those Jews who believed in him, 'If you remain in my word, you will truly be my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.'" (John 8:31-32, NABRE)

Scripture tells us that Jesus is "the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6). Love cannot exist without truth. When we separate love from truth:

- We enable harmful behaviors
- We fail to help others grow
- We create false relationships built on illusion

> **CCC 2466**: "The right to the communication of the truth is not unconditional. Everyone must conform his life to the Gospel precept of fraternal love. This requires us in concrete situations to judge whether or not it is appropriate to reveal the truth to someone who asks for it."

True love always speaks and lives in truth, even when difficult.

### Justice

> "You have been told, O mortal, what is good, and what the LORD requires of you: Only to do justice and to love goodness, and to walk humbly with your God." (Micah 6:8, NABRE)

Justice is about right relationship—giving to God and others what is due to them based on their inherent dignity. Love without justice becomes:

- Enabling of harmful behaviors
- Lacking in accountability
- Unable to protect the vulnerable

> **CCC 1807**: "Justice is the moral virtue that consists in the constant and firm will to give their due to God and neighbor. Justice toward God is called the 'virtue of religion.' Justice toward men disposes one to respect the rights of each and to establish in human relationships the harmony that promotes equity with regard to persons and to the common good."

Justice reminds us that love must respect boundaries, uphold dignity, and work toward the authentic good of the other.

### Mercy

> "Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful." (Luke 6:36, NABRE)

Mercy is God's love encountering human brokenness. It is not opposed to justice but fulfills it. When we separate mercy from love:

- We become harsh and judgmental
- We fail to see the person behind the sin
- We forget our own need for forgiveness

> **CCC 1829**: "The fruits of charity are joy, peace, and mercy; charity demands beneficence and fraternal correction; it is benevolence; it fosters reciprocity and remains disinterested and generous; it is friendship and communion."

> **CCC 2447**: "The works of mercy are charitable actions by which we come to the aid of our neighbor in his spiritual and bodily necessities. Instructing, advising, consoling, comforting are spiritual works of mercy, as are forgiving and bearing wrongs patiently. The corporal works of mercy consist especially in feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and imprisoned, and burying the dead."

The Cross is the perfect example of mercy and justice meeting—where Christ pays the price of justice while extending the gift of mercy.

> "But God proves his love for us in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us." (Romans 5:8, NABRE)

### Small Group Discussion

**Question:** "Recall a time when you witnessed a profound failure of love—either in your own life or in society—because one element (truth, justice, or mercy) was missing or distorted. How might the situation have been different if all three elements had been present in balance?"

## Part 3: Love in Action (15 minutes)

### Scripture Reading

> "This is my commandment: love one another as I love you. No one has greater love than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you. I no longer call you slaves, because a slave does not know what his master is doing. I have called you friends, because I have told you everything I have heard from my Father. It was not you who chose me, but I who chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit that will remain, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you. This I command you: love one another." (John 15:12-17, NABRE)

### The Sacramental Life

The sacraments are encounters with God's love that transform us:

- **Baptism**: We are immersed in God's love and made His children
- **Eucharist**: We receive Christ's sacrificial love and are united with Him
- **Reconciliation**: We experience God's merciful love and forgiveness
- **Marriage**: Spouses image God's faithful, fruitful love

> **CCC 1116**: "Sacraments are 'powers that come forth' from the Body of Christ, which is ever-living and life-giving. They are actions of the Holy Spirit at work in his Body, the Church. They are 'the masterworks of God' in the new and everlasting covenant."

> **CCC 1394**: "As bodily nourishment restores lost strength, so the Eucharist strengthens our charity, which tends to be weakened in daily life; and this living charity wipes away venial sins."

### The Virtuous Life

Love is lived through the virtues:

- **Faith**: Trusting in God's love even when we cannot see it
- **Hope**: Confidently expecting the fulfillment of God's promises
- **Prudence**: Making wise decisions guided by love
- **Justice**: Giving others what love requires
- **Fortitude**: Persevering in love through difficulties
- **Temperance**: Moderating our desires out of love for God and others

> **CCC 1827**: "The practice of all the virtues is animated and inspired by charity, which 'binds everything together in perfect harmony'; it is the form of the virtues; it articulates and orders them among themselves; it is the source and the goal of their Christian practice. Charity upholds and purifies our human ability to love, and raises it to the supernatural perfection of divine love."

### Family and Community Life

> "Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, heartfelt compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience, bearing with one another and forgiving one another, if one has a grievance against another; as the Lord has forgiven you, so must you also do. And over all these put on love, that is, the bond of perfection." (Colossians 3:12-14, NABRE)

Love is first learned and practiced in families:

- Parents model God's love to their children
- Family members practice forgiveness and sacrifice
- The family becomes a "domestic church" where love is lived daily

> **CCC 2204**: "The Christian family constitutes a specific revelation and realization of ecclesial communion, and for this reason it can and should be called a domestic church."

The parish community extends this family love:

- We support one another in faith
- We practice works of mercy together
- We witness to God's love in the wider community

> **CCC 2179**: "The parish is the Eucharistic community and the heart of the liturgical life of Christian families; it is a privileged place for the catechesis of children and parents."

### Small Group Discussion

**Question:** "What is the most challenging aspect of living out authentic love in your daily life? What specific sacrament or virtue do you believe could most strengthen your capacity to love as Christ loves, and why?"

## Reflection and Discussion (15 minutes)

1. Reflect on a time when you experienced love that clearly united truth, justice, and mercy. How did this experience differ from other expressions of "love" you've encountered?
2. Where in your life do you struggle most to integrate truth, justice, and mercy in your expression of love?
3. How does the Catholic understanding of love challenge or affirm your previous understanding of love?
4. What is one concrete way you can better live out the theological virtue of love this week?

## Closing: The Call to Love (5 minutes)

> "In this is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as expiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also must love one another." (1 John 4:10-11, NABRE)

As Catholics, we are called not just to believe in love but to become love. Through the grace of the Holy Spirit and our cooperation with that grace, we gradually grow in our capacity to love as God loves.

> **CCC 1824**: "Fruit of the Spirit and fullness of the Law, charity keeps the commandments of God and his Christ: 'Abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love.'"

St. John of the Cross reminds us: "In the evening of life, we will be judged on love alone."

This week, I invite you to:

1. Pray daily for the grace to grow in love
2. Identify one relationship where you can better integrate truth, justice, and mercy
3. Perform one concrete act of love that requires sacrifice

### Small Group Discussion

**Question:** "If you were to be judged solely on how you have loved others, as St. John of the Cross suggests, what would you want God to see in your life? What specific change in how you love could begin transforming your relationships starting tomorrow?"

## Closing Prayer

Lord Jesus Christ,
You taught us that there is no greater love than to lay down one's life for others.
Help us to grow in this theological virtue of love,
To see with your eyes, to love with your heart,
And to serve with your hands.

Grant us the wisdom to speak truth in love,
The courage to uphold justice with compassion,
And the humility to extend mercy as we have received it.

May our lives become a living witness to your perfect love—
A love that is sacred, sacrificial, and covenant-binding,
A love that unites truth, justice, and mercy
In life-giving communion with you and one another.

We ask this through Christ our Lord.
Amen.
