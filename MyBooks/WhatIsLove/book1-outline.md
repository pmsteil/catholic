# *What is Love?: Recovering the Heart of the Gospel: Justice, and Mercy in Action*

## Book Purpose

Looking around in today's world, we see society breaking down and hear countless demands for justice, equity, inclusion, and an end to various forms of oppression. Yet as the song goes, many are "looking for love in all the wrong places." After studying the Faith for 35+ years and observing what has happened in my own life and with society, I am firmly convinced that the problem and solution to societal breakdown, both in modern times and ancient, is breakdown in the fundamental understanding of THE most critical question:

>
>
> ## What is Love?
>
>

One answer is...

>
>
> ## God is Love. (1 John 4:8)
>
>

This book is intended to help all Christ followers understand the depth and beauty of what it means to say God is Love.  Here is the Catholic answer of what love is:

>
> Perfect love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant-binding truth, justice, and mercy into life-giving communion.

*Key Scriptures:*
- "You have been told, O mortal, what is good, and what the LORD requires of you: Only to do justice and to love goodness, and to walk humbly with your God." (Micah 6:8, NABRE)
- "Love and truth will meet; justice and peace will kiss. Truth will spring from the earth; justice will look down from heaven." (Psalm 85:10-11, NABRE)
- "Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, heartfelt compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience... And over all these put on love, that is, the bond of perfection." (Colossians 3:12, 14, NABRE)
- "Living the truth in love, we should grow in every way into him who is the head, Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament... builds itself up in love." (Ephesians 4:15-16, NABRE)

The Catholic teaching is that the goal of the faith is not merely to "get to heaven" but to enter into a transformative LOVE relationship with the Trinity (and each other) LIVING that out here and now with our whole heart, soul, mind, and strength and to desire this unity both now and eternally.

And so to attain this goal we must attempt to approach the truth about God's perfect wisdom and unity of love, justice, and mercy.  Of course, we are not God - we do not know the whole truth about God's perfect wisdom and unity of love, justice, and mercy.

But, as Jesus promised the Disciples...

> "I have much more to tell you, but you cannot bear it now. 13 But when he comes, the Spirit of truth, he will guide you to all truth." (John 16:12-13, NABRE)

The same Disciples that he gave His authority to baptize and teach EVERYTHING He commanded:

> Then Jesus approached and said to them,

   > All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, until the end of the age.

And so, for 2000 years, the Church has been guided by the Holy Spirit to know as much as He has revealed to us about the truth about God's perfect wisdom and unity of love, justice, and mercy and to teach it to us.

And the most beautiful thing about our Faith is that it is TRUE.  In other words, the Catholic Faith is so perfectly aligned with reality.  The truth of human nature, the truth of the human condition, the truth of the universe, and the truth of God's plan for His creation is all contained in the Catholic Faith.

There is not a single logical leap that the Catholic Faith asks you to take that is not supported by the reality of the world we find ourselves in. God has been revealing His Truth to us for thousands of years and the Catholic Faith is the perfect summary of that truth.

The book will show how the desire for true justice and mercy are deeply engrained in our souls. And how the Catholic Faith is the most perfect teaching of how we can pursue a complete and true and unified understanding of justice, mercy, and truth.

We definitely see that in the real world:
* Justice without mercy becomes oppressive
* Mercy without justice becomes enabling
* Truth without justice or mercy leads to literal death of millions

Only when the three elements of truth, justice, and mercy are in a more perfect balance can we experience and extend and experience authentic love, peace, and joy.

The Catholic Faith, guided by the Holy Spirit for 2000 years, offers this integrated understanding of love through:

* UNITY in the Body of Christ, submitting to the authority Jesus established in the Church
* COMMUNION with Christ himself, experienced most fully in the Eucharist and all Sacraments
* WORSHIP through the Mass, forming us as reverent, humble servants of His love
* TRUTH through Scripture and the Church's Magisterium
* JUSTICE through the Church's social teaching
* MERCY through Christ's sacrifice on the Cross
* GRACE (His justice and mercy) through the Holy Spirit working through the Sacraments to help perfect us

This book will walk through the major teachings of the Catholic Faith to show how each element helps us understand and live out our relationship between love, truth, justice, and mercy. Our Faith is not just a set of beliefs but a deep and beautiful way of life that transforms us and, through us, the world.

>  Jesus said to him, "I am the way and the truth[a] and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. (John 14:6)

My prayer is that the world will come to know Jesus who is THE Way and THE Truth and THE Life — that He IS the incarnation of perfect love as the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant-binding truth, justice, and mercy into a life-giving communion that we both desire and NEED — and that the Catholic Faith will continue to be a light to the World and salt of the Earth.

**Audience:** Catholic Christians seeking to deepen their understanding of faith beyond ritual participation

## Introduction: A Roadmap for the Journey

*This new introduction provides readers with a clear overview of the book's structure and purpose.*

This book is organized into three parts that will guide you on a journey toward a deeper understanding of love as the perfect unity of truth, justice, and mercy:

1. **Part I: The Problem and the Promise** - We'll examine the challenges of our current cultural moment, the universal human intuition for justice and mercy, and introduce the Catholic vision of love as the solution.
2. **Part II: The Foundation of Love** - We'll explore the theological foundations of authentic love: human dignity, truth, mercy, justice, faith, and the Cross as the perfect integration of all these elements.
3. **Part III: Love in Action** - We'll discover how to live out this integrated vision of love through the commandments, virtues, sacraments, family life, and the universal call to holiness.

Throughout this journey, we'll continually return to our central framework: perfect love as the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant-binding truth, justice, and mercy into life-giving communion. Each chapter will help us understand how these elements work together in God's plan and how we can participate in this divine love in our daily lives.

## PART I: THE PROBLEM AND THE PROMISE

### Chapter 1: The Desire for the Good: Exposing Virtue Signaling

*Premise: Modern society has created a "tradition" of leaders promoting ideas that sound virtuous but lack foundation, resulting in well-intentioned followers regurgitating concepts like "equity" and "inclusion" without understanding their true meaning or how to achieve them.*

*Key Scriptures:*
- "People will be self-centered and lovers of money, proud, haughty, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, irreligious, callous, implacable, slanderous, licentious, brutal, hating what is good, traitors, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, as they make a pretense of religion but deny its power." (2 Timothy 3:2-5, NABRE)
- "Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but underneath are ravenous wolves. By their fruits you will know them." (Matthew 7:15-16, NABRE)
- "Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the road broad that leads to destruction, and those who enter through it are many. How narrow the gate and constricted the road that leads to life. And those who find it are few." (Matthew 7:13-14, NABRE)
- "Why do you notice the splinter in your brother's eye, but do not perceive the wooden beam in your own eye?" (Matthew 7:3, NABRE)
- "Thus you nullify the word of God in favor of your tradition that you have handed on. And you do many such things." (Mark 7:13, NABRE)
- "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites. You are like whitewashed tombs, which appear beautiful on the outside, but inside are full of dead men's bones and every kind of filth." (Matthew 23:27, NABRE)
- "For they preach but they do not practice." (Matthew 23:3, NABRE)
- "If I speak in human and angelic tongues but do not have love, I am a resounding gong or a clashing cymbal." (1 Corinthians 13:1, NABRE)
- "For the time will come when people will not tolerate sound doctrine but, following their own desires and insatiable curiosity, will accumulate teachers and will stop listening to the truth and will be diverted to myths." (2 Timothy 4:3-4, NABRE)
- "They promise them freedom, though they themselves are slaves of corruption, for a person is a slave of whatever overcomes him." (2 Peter 2:19, NABRE)
- "Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who change darkness into light and light into darkness, who change bitter into sweet and sweet into bitter!" (Isaiah 5:20, NABRE)

1. **The Disconnect:** Begin by painting a vivid picture of the problems:
   * Widespread societal disorientation and disconnect from reality
   * The loss of shared values and a sense of common purpose
   * Increased polarization, conflict, and distrust
   * The rise of "virtue signaling," performative activism, and shallow engagement
2. **The Symptoms of the Disease:** Connect these problems to specific manifestations:
   * "Wokeness" and its often-unintended consequences
   * The proliferation of "fake racism" accusations and race-baiting
   * The distorted understanding of "reproductive rights"
   * The challenges posed by transgender ideology
3. **What Wokeness Is Fighting For, But Where It Went Wrong:** Examine the legitimate concerns and fundamental errors:
   * The valid desire for justice and equality that drives these movements
   * The Marxist foundation that derails modern movements (wokeness, intersectionality, critical theories)
   * The error of reducing human relations to power dynamics
   * Why seeking power as the primary goal creates perpetual injustice
   * The mistake of blaming groups rather than addressing individual sin and disorder
   * Why societal problems cannot be solved without ordering individual desires toward true justice
   * The impossibility of achieving justice through collective blame and power redistribution
   * How these movements misdiagnose the human condition and therefore prescribe ineffective remedies
4. **The Underlying Cause: A Loss of Foundation:** Explain that all of these issues stem from a deeper problem:
   * The absence of any objective standard or guiding principles of truth resulting in justice and mercy run amok
   * A reliance on subjective feelings, emotions, and personal opinions
   * A "progressive" movement that is without any boundaries or limits or "commandments" - everything is relative and fluid
   * A disconnect from the natural world and the realities of the human body, mind, and soul
5. **The Yearning for Something More:** Acknowledge that even in these misguided movements, there's a kernel of truth:
   * A genuine desire for freedom, justice, mercy, and virtue
   * A passion for fighting for ideals and making the world a better place
   * But these desires are misdirected without a solid foundation
6. **From Wokeness to True Justice and Mercy:**

    *   The leap is from wokeness to the truth about the intuition we have about justice and mercy.
    *   The Catholic faith is the most perfect teaching we have on how to pursue an objective and true justice and mercy.
    *   In upholding true justice - that all human beings are God's creations and have rights to self preservation, dignity, charity, etc, the catholic answer is better than the woke answer that continually separates and divides people and even calls for more discrimination based on race.
7. **A Call to Action for Catholics:** Challenge Catholics to take their faith more seriously:
   * We need to know, live, and teach our faith better than ever before
   * This is how we evangelize: one person, one family at a time
   * This is our time to truly be able to tell the complete story of the whole "Gospel" – the good news
   * We have the answers the world is searching for

> This chapter reveals that virtue signaling is a hollow substitute for true virtue and that the Catholic faith offers a more authentic path to the good, rooted in objective truth, genuine love, true justice, and real mercy.

#### For Reflection and Discussion:

   1. What legitimate human desire or need do you think underlies the phenomenon of virtue signaling? How does the Catholic understanding of virtue fulfill this desire more authentically?
   2. Reflect on a time when you encountered "virtue signaling" in your own life. How did you respond, and what did this experience reveal about the difference between authentic virtue and its counterfeit?
   3. How does our culture's emphasis on public displays of virtue often miss the deeper meaning of true goodness? What consequences do you see resulting from this superficial approach?
   4. In what area of your life might you be substituting the appearance of virtue for genuine love? What would it look like to move beyond signaling to authentic action?

### Chapter 2: The Intuition of Justice: Our Innate Moral Compass

*Premise: Our universal human intuitions for justice, equality, freedom, and dignity are not arbitrary social constructs but evidence of our creation in God's image and signposts pointing to divine truth.*

*Key Scriptures:*
- "He has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?" (Micah 6:8, NABRE)
- "The work of justice will be peace; the effect of justice, calm and security forever." (Isaiah 32:17, NABRE)
- "For when the Gentiles who do not have the law by nature observe the prescriptions of the law, they are a law for themselves even though they do not have the law." (Romans 2:14, NABRE)
- "They show that the demands of the law are written in their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even defend them." (Romans 2:15, NABRE)

1. **Where Modern Movements Get It Right:**
   * Acknowledging the legitimate concerns that drive social justice movements
   * The valid intuition that something is deeply wrong with the status quo
   * The righteous anger against genuine oppression and exploitation
   * The desire to create a more just and equitable society
2. **What Our Intuitions Tell Us:**
   * Our sense of justice points to an objective moral order
   * Our desire for equality reflects our common human dignity
   * Our longing for freedom indicates our created purpose
   * Our capacity for mercy and forgiveness suggests a design beyond mere survival
   * Our outrage at suffering suggests a world not designed for pain
3. **Where Modern Movements Go Astray:**
   * Disconnecting these intuitions from their divine source
   * Attempting to build justice without a foundation in truth
   * Pursuing freedom without understanding its purpose
   * Seeking equality while denying human nature
4. **Christianity's Foundational Claims:**
   * **Truth:** There is objective truth about human nature and purpose, revealed by God
   * **Human Dignity:** All humans possess inherent, equal dignity as bearers of God's image
   * **Sin and Brokenness:** The world is not as it should be due to human sin and rebellion
   * **Redemption:** God has not abandoned us but entered our broken world to heal it
   * **Covenant and Community:** God establishes covenant relationships, not mere contracts, calling us into the Body of Christ
   * **Love:** The ultimate reality behind the universe is not power but self-giving love
   * **Justice and Mercy:** God perfectly unites justice with mercy, providing a model for human society
   * **Transformation:** Lasting social change requires inner transformation, not just external reforms
5. **Comparing Modern Ideologies with Christian Approaches:**
   * **On Human Dignity:**
     * Modern view: Dignity based on autonomy, self-determination, or social utility
     * Christian view: Inherent dignity based on creation in God's image, regardless of ability, utility, or stage of development
   * **On Justice:**
     * Modern view: Justice as power redistribution or equality of outcomes
     * Christian view: Justice as right relationships, giving each person their due according to their nature and needs
   * **On Freedom:**
     * Modern view: Freedom as absence of constraints or ability to define one's own reality
     * Christian view: Freedom as the ability to choose the good, to become who we were created to be
   * **On Suffering:**
     * Modern view: Suffering as meaningless, to be eliminated at all costs
     * Christian view: Suffering as potentially redemptive when united with Christ's sacrifice
   * **On Community:**
     * Modern view: Community as voluntary association of autonomous individuals
     * Christian view: Community as organic body with mutual responsibilities and interdependence
6. **The Distinctive Christian Difference:**
   * Why Christianity offers more than just another ideology or moral system
   * How the Incarnation changes everything: God enters human suffering
   * The unique Christian understanding of love as self-gift rather than self-fulfillment
   * The historical evidence of Christianity's transformative impact on human rights, dignity, and justice
7. **From Intuition to Revelation:**
   * How our moral intuitions are signposts pointing to God
   * Why these intuitions need divine revelation for their fulfillment
   * Christianity as the answer to our deepest moral yearnings
   * These intuitions find their fullest expression in the Catholic tradition
   * Introducing love as the unifying principle that integrates justice, truth, and mercy
   * Universal moral intuitions are impossible to explain in purely materialistic worldviews
   * If humans evolved solely for survival, consistent moral intuitions that contradict self-interest make little sense
   * The Catholic understanding provides a more coherent explanation: these intuitions are divine signposts
   * Romans 2:15 confirms this: "They show that the demands of the law are written in their hearts"
   * These signposts, however, require the guidance of the Church to interpret them correctly and avoid misdirection.
   * These moral intuitions require divine revelation for their complete fulfillment

> This chapter argues that our innate sense of justice is a signpost pointing to God and that the Catholic faith provides the most complete framework for understanding and fulfilling these intuitions.

#### For Reflection and Discussion:

   1. Reflect on a time when you felt a strong sense of "that's not fair!" What does this reaction reveal about your innate moral compass?
   2. How do your deepest intuitions about justice, equality, and human dignity point toward God's existence and nature?
   3. In what ways do you see modern movements correctly identifying problems but prescribing inadequate solutions?
   4. Compare how a secular ideology and Christianity might approach a current social justice issue. What are the fundamental differences in their approaches?

### Chapter 3: What is Love? The Heart of the Gospel

*Goal: Introduce the Catholic understanding of love as the foundation of the faith.*

*Key Scriptures:*
- "God is love, and whoever remains in love remains in God and God in him." (1 John 4:16, NABRE)
- "I give you a new commandment: love one another. As I have loved you, so you also should love one another." (John 13:34-35, NABRE)
- "Whoever has my commandments and observes them is the one who loves me. And whoever loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and reveal myself to him." (John 14:21, NABRE)
- "For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but might have eternal life." (John 3:16, NABRE)
- "In this is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as expiation for our sins." (1 John 4:10, NABRE)
- "Beloved, if God so loved us, we also must love one another." (1 John 4:11, NABRE)
- "Love is patient, love is kind. It is not jealous, [love] is not pompous, it is not inflated, it is not rude, it does not seek its own interests, it is not quick-tempered, it does not brood over injury, it does not rejoice over wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth." (1 Corinthians 13:4-6, NABRE)
- "So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love." (1 Corinthians 13:13, NABRE)
- "No one has greater love than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends." (John 15:13, NABRE)
- "In this way the love of God was revealed to us: God sent his only Son into the world so that we might have life through him." (1 John 4:9, NABRE)
- "There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment, and so one who fears is not yet perfect in love." (1 John 4:18, NABRE)
- "We love because he first loved us." (1 John 4:19, NABRE)
- "If anyone says, 'I love God,' but hates his brother, he is a liar; for whoever does not love a brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen." (1 John 4:20, NABRE)

1. **God is Love:** The Trinity as perfect communion of love
   * The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as eternal exchange of love
   * How the Trinity reveals the relational nature of love
   * Love as the essence of God's being, not just an attribute
2. **The Church's Definition of Love:**
   * The Catechism's formal definition of love (CCC 1822-1829)
   * Pope Benedict XVI's teaching on love in Deus Caritas Est
   * St. Thomas Aquinas on love as "willing the good of the other"
   * The distinction between agape, philia, and eros in Christian tradition
   * How the Church's understanding of love differs from secular definitions
   * The importance of free will in choosing to love.
3. **Love as Sacred, Sacrificia Gift of Covenant:** Proposing a new synthesis of love:
   * Building upon the Church's rich theological tradition throughout the centuries
   * While acknowledging my human limitations in defining divine love, after extensive prayer, biblical study, and consultation with others, I propose:
   * Perfect love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant-binding truth, justice, and mercy into life-giving communion.
     - Sacred: Originating FROM and participating in God's divine nature
     - Sacrificial: Following Christ's example showing how love REQUIRES sacrifice
     - Covenant: Establishing a binding relationship with obligations and promises
     - Binding: Uniting potentially competing elements of truth, justice, and mercy into harmony
     - Truth: Seeing reality as God sees it
     - Justice: Giving God and others their due
     - Mercy: Responding to brokenness with compassion
     - Life-giving: Generating new life and transformation for the good of others
     - Communion: Creating a deep unity with God and others
   * This definition seeks to synthesize and integrate the wisdom of Scripture, Church Fathers, and magisterial teaching
   * Though necessarily imperfect (as all human attempts to define the divine must be), this formulation addresses modern misconceptions while preserving timeless truth
   * It offers a more complete picture than partial understandings that emphasize one dimension at the expense of others
   * Most importantly, this gives us a more concrete way to understand and live out love in our daily lives, and to help others who do not know God, to see how essential it is to participate in this covenant of truth, justice, and mercy. In other words, it gives us language to explain love through the human intuitions of truth, justice, and mercy.
4. **The Connection Between Love and Human Dignity:**
   * Human dignity REQUIRES authentic love and authentic love REQUIRES human dignity
   * Our creation in God's image enables us to participate in unified love
   * Because God is love—a Trinity of truth, justice, and mercy—we can reflect this integrated love
   * Our dignity flows from being created by Love itself for the purpose of loving as God loves
   * We are designed to be both recipients and channels of divine love
5. **The Holy Spirit as the Animator of Love:**
   * The Holy Spirit as the love between Father and Son
   * How the Spirit dwells within us, enabling us to love authentically
   * The gifts of the Holy Spirit (wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord) as empowering our capacity to love
   * The fruits of the Spirit (love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, etc.) as manifestations of authentic love
   * Pentecost as the birthday of the Church and the outpouring of love
6. **Why Understanding Love Matters:**
   * Love as the heart of the Gospel message
   * How a distorted understanding of love leads to distorted faith
   * The connection between loving God and knowing God
7. **The Distortion of Love in Modern Culture:**
   * Love reduced to sentiment or emotion
   * Love divorced from truth and commitment
   * The consequences of this distortion for individuals and society
8. **Preview of the Journey Ahead:**
   * How we'll explore each dimension of love
   * The promise of a more integrated and authentic faith
   * The transformation that comes from living in authentic love
9. **Salvation as Love Relationship:**
   * Beyond "getting to heaven" - salvation as communion with God
   * How "the faith" differs from mere intellectual assent
   * Why "faith alone" misunderstands the nature of salvation: healing us FOR love
   * Sin as slavery that prevents authentic love
   * Salvation as liberation for loving relationship with God and neighbor
   * Salvation as both gift and response
10. **The Cost of Love:**

     Jesus' invitation: "Deny yourself, take up your cross, and follow me"
     Why authentic love always involves sacrifice
     The paradox of finding life by losing it
     Setting expectations: the Christian life is demanding but fulfilling

> This chapter introduces the Catholic understanding of love as the perfect unity of truth, justice, and mercy and emphasizes that salvation is not merely about "getting to heaven" but about entering into a transformative love relationship with God, which is the ultimate goal of our existence.

#### For Reflection and Discussion:

   1. What authentic human longing do you think drives our culture's obsession with love, even when misunderstood? How does the Catholic vision of love as truth, justice, and mercy in unity fulfill this longing?
   2. Recall a moment when you experienced love that clearly united truth, justice, and mercy. How did this experience differ from other expressions of "love" you've encountered?
   3. How does our culture's definition of love often separate it from truth, justice, or mercy? What consequences do you see from this fragmented understanding?
   4. Where in your life do you struggle most to integrate truth, justice, and mercy in your expression of love? What would it look like to move beyond signaling to authentic action?

## PART II: THE FOUNDATION OF LOVE

### Chapter 4: Human Dignity: Created for Love and Our Divine Origin

*Goal: Establish the anthropological foundation for love in our creation and human dignity as the basis for all human rights, justice, and mercy.*

*Key Scriptures:*
- "God created mankind in his image; in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them." (Genesis 1:27, NABRE)
- "The LORD God then took the man and settled him in the garden of Eden, to cultivate and care for it." (Genesis 2:15, NABRE)
- "For you formed my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise you, because I am fearfully and wonderfully made." (Psalm 139:13-14, NABRE)
- "The LORD God said: It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suited to him." (Genesis 2:18, NABRE)
- "That is why a man leaves his father and mother and clings to his wife, and the two of them become one body." (Genesis 2:24, NABRE)
- "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I dedicated you, a prophet to the nations I appointed you." (Jeremiah 1:5, NABRE)
- "What profit is there for one to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?" (Mark 8:36, NABRE)
- "For the creation waits with eager expectation for the revelation of the children of God." (Romans 8:19, NABRE)
- "For the creation was made subject to futility, not of its own accord but because of the one who subjected it, in hope that creation itself would be set free from slavery to corruption and share in the glorious freedom of the children of God." (Romans 8:20-21, NABRE)

1. **Made in God's Image and Likeness:**
   * What it means to be created in the image of a God who is love
   * Our capacity for relationship, knowledge, and self-gift
   * The dignity that comes from our divine origin
2. **The Original Design:**
   * Communion with God and others as our natural state
   * The harmony of the garden before the fall
   * The integration of body and soul in the human person
3. **The Wound of Original Sin:**
   * How sin disrupted our capacity to love authentically
   * The four wounds: ignorance, malice, weakness, and desire
   * The continuing effects of original sin in our lives
4. **The Yearning That Remains:**
   * The universal human desire for love and connection
   * How even distorted desires point to our created purpose
   * The restlessness of the human heart until it rests in God
5. **Our Dignity as Children of God:**
   * How our divine origin gives us inherent worth
   * The call to live in accordance with our dignity
   * How understanding our origin shapes our destiny

> This chapter establishes the anthropological foundation for love in our creation and human dignity as the basis for all human rights, justice, and mercy.

#### For Reflection and Discussion:

   1. What genuine human desire for significance and worth do you think drives modern identity movements? How does the Catholic understanding of human dignity better fulfill this desire?
   2. Think about a time when you felt most aware of being created in God's image. What circumstances or insights led to this awareness, and how did it affect your sense of purpose?
   3. How does our society's understanding of human dignity differ from the Catholic vision of being created in God's image? What harmful consequences result from this difference?
   4. In what ways might you be living beneath your dignity as a child of God? What area of your life needs to be more aligned with your divine origin?

### Chapter 5: Truth: God's Self-Disclosure Through Creation, Scripture, and Tradition

*Premise: Truth is not merely a concept but flows from the Trinity—Father as Creator, Son as Redeemer, and Holy Spirit as Sustainer—whose mutual love and unity reveal reality as God sees it, offering clear standards for genuine freedom, justice, equality, and human rights.*

*Key Scriptures:*
- "The truth will set you free." (John 8:32, NABRE)
- "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." (John 14:6, NABRE)
- "But when he comes, the Spirit of truth, he will guide you to all truth." (John 16:13, NABRE)
- "For this I was born and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice." (John 18:37, NABRE)
- "Sanctify them in the truth. Your word is truth." (John 17:17, NABRE)
- "God is Spirit, and those who worship him must worship in Spirit and truth." (John 4:24, NABRE)
- "If you remain in my word, you will truly be my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free." (John 8:31-32, NABRE)

* Scriptures for backing up the binding ourselves to God and his truth, justice, and mercy:
      - Submission to God's Will & Wisdom over Our Own:

         Proverbs 3:5-6: "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not rely on your own insight. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths." (This directly contrasts relying on our own insight with trusting God's guidance).
         Matthew 6:10 (Lord's Prayer): "Your kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven." (The fundamental prayer taught by Jesus includes submitting to God's will).
         Matthew 26:39: During His agony in the garden, Jesus prays, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not what I want but what you want." (Jesus Himself models perfect submission to the Father's will, even in suffering).
         1 Corinthians 1:25: "For God’s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God’s weakness is stronger than human strength." (Highlights the superiority of God's wisdom).
         James 4:7: "Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you." (Direct command to submit to God).

      - Being Bound by Truth:

         John 14:6: Jesus said to him, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." (Jesus embodies Truth, so submitting to God means submitting to Him).
         John 8:31-32: "If you continue in my word, you are truly my disciples; and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free." (Adherence to Christ's teaching—the Truth—is essential).
         1 Timothy 3:15: "...the church of the living God, the pillar and bulwark of the truth." (The Church is presented as the foundation upholding God's truth, to which we are bound).

      - Being Bound by Justice:

         Micah 6:8: "He has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?" (Justice is a direct requirement from God).
         Matthew 23:23: "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint, dill, and cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. It is these you ought to have practiced without neglecting the others." (Jesus emphasizes justice and mercy as core tenets).
         Deuteronomy 16:20: "Justice, and only justice, you shall pursue..." (A clear command to follow justice).

      - Being Bound by Mercy:

         Luke 6:36: "Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful." (We are called to imitate God's mercy).
         Matthew 5:7: "Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy." (Mercy is presented as a condition for receiving God's mercy).
         James 2:13: "For judgment will be without mercy to anyone who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment." (Emphasizes the importance and power of mercy).

      - Being Bound by Love:


         The Greatest Commandment:

            Luke 10:25-28: "Just then a lawyer stood up to test Jesus. 'Teacher,' he said, 'what must I do to inherit eternal life?' He said to him, 'What is written in the law? What do you read there?' He answered, 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.' And he said to him, 'You have given the right answer; do this, and you will live.'"

            Matthew 22:37-40: Jesus identifies the greatest commandments: "'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.' This is the greatest and first commandment. And a second is like it: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." This explicitly states that the entire moral framework given by God (Law and Prophets) is bound up in, and dependent upon, love for God and neighbor.

         The New Commandment & Sign of Discipleship:

            John 13:34-35: "I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another." Love isn't just suggested; it's commanded by Christ Himself, modeled on His own sacrificial love, and serves as the defining mark of His followers.

         Love as the Fulfillment of the Law:

            Romans 13:8-10: "Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law... Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore, love is the fulfilling of the law." Paul teaches that genuine love inherently leads one to act rightly towards others, thus fulfilling the specific prohibitions and commands of the Law.
            Galatians 5:14: "For the whole law is summed up in a single commandment, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'"

         Love Rooted in God's Nature:

            1 John 4:7-8, 16: "Beloved, let us love one another, because love is from God; everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love... God is love, and those who abide in love abide in God, and God abides in them." We are bound to love because God is love. To know God and live in relationship with Him necessitates living in love.
            1 John 4:19-21: "We love because he first loved us. Those who say, 'I love God,' and hate their brothers or sisters, are liars... The commandment we have from him is this: those who love God must love their brothers and sisters also." Love for God is inseparable from love for others; it's a binding command stemming from God's own prior love for us.

         Love as the Guiding Principle:

            1 Corinthians 13: While often read at weddings, this chapter describes agape love as the essential virtue without which all other gifts and actions are meaningless. It details the characteristics of this binding love (patient, kind, not envious, etc.).
            Ephesians 5:1-2: "Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children, and live in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God." We are commanded to "live in love," imitating Christ's sacrificial love.
