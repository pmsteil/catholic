# First Draft Writing Plan: Outline to Section Files

## Objective

Systematically generate the complete first draft of the book by expanding the provided outline into individual markdown files for every designated section/chapter.

## Input:

A detailed Book Outline (`book1-outline_gemini_25_final.md`) that includes all major sections and chapters. Specific writing guidelines are provided below.

## Writing Style and Guidelines
1.   **Writing Style Reference:** Use the provided `book1-blogpost-for-catholics.md` as a reference for writing style, tone, and approach. Incorporate relevant content, examples, and anecdotes from this blog post where appropriate throughout the draft.
2.   **Core Purpose:** To help everyday Catholic Christians deepen their understanding and practice of authentic love, grounded in the unity of truth, justice, and mercy, as revealed through Scripture and Tradition. This book aims to equip Catholics to become laser focused in the practice of their faith to engage confidently with contemporary cultural challenges.
4.   **Desired Tone:** Personal, direct, urgent, relatable, and passionately evangelistic/apologetic (similar to the `book1-blogpost-for-catholics.md`). Use "we" and "us" frequently to connect with the reader. Incorporate personal anecdotes (marked with placeholders like `[Author Anecdote: ...]`) to illustrate points. Maintain a sense of hope and confidence in the beauty and truth of the Catholic faith.
5.   **Central Definition of Love (Integrate Throughout):**

    > **Perfect Love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and true mercy into life-giving communion.**
    > _(Shorter form: Love is the unity of God's true justice and true mercy.)_

    *   **Breakdown:** Explicitly break down _each_ component (sacred, sacrificial, gift, covenant, binds, true justice, true mercy, life-giving, communion) in Chapter 3.
    *   **Application:** Consistently use this definition as a lens to analyze topics in every chapter. Regularly ask variations of: "How does this teaching/sacrament/virtue reveal the _sacred/sacrificial/covenantal/binding/truth/justice/mercy/life-giving/communion_ aspect of God's love?" Use blockquotes for emphasis on this definition when reintroduced.

## File Structure and Drafting Process

1.  **File Structure Setup:** Based on the `book1-outline_gemini_25_final.md` outline, create the following separate document files (using `.md` format unless otherwise specified) and as you complete each file, mark it as completed with a green checkmark (✅):

    *   [] - `./book1_v2/22_Appendix_A_Love_vs_Counterfeits.md`
    *   [] - `./book1_v2/23_Appendix_B_Tools_for_Formation.md`
2.  **Section-by-Section Drafting:**
    *   Select the next incomplete section/chapter to work on.
    *   Consult the corresponding points for that specific section within the Book Outline.
    *   Write the initial draft content for that section directly into its dedicated file, using the outline points as a structural guide and checklist.
    *   Focus on translating outline points into prose, developing ideas, elaborating on concepts, building narrative or arguments, and ensuring all planned topics for the section are addressed.
        *  Use Scripture references and other relevant content from the outline as needed. Give the reader references to more Scripture for deeper study.
        *  Use the provided `book1-blogpost-for-catholics.md` as a reference for style and content, integrating relevant examples and anecdotes.
    *   Ensure the content is engaging, accessible, and relatable to the target audience.
    *   Use the core definition of love as a lens to analyze and connect topics within each section.
    *   Include reflection questions at the end of each chapter to encourage personal application and deeper contemplation.
    *   Add "Practice & Habit" sections with actionable steps for readers to apply the chapter's teachings in their daily lives.
    *   Use the following formatting conventions:
        *   Use blockquotes for key definitions, tips, or sidebars.
        *   Use headings and subheadings to structure the content clearly.
        *   Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity where appropriate.
    *   Use placeholders for personal anecdotes (e.g., `[Author Anecdote: ...]`) to be filled in later.
    *   Ensure each section/chapter file is comprehensive, covering all points in the outline for that section.
    *   Mark the section file as complete with a green checkmark (✅) when it is fully drafted and ready for review.
        *  Use references from the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) where appropriate, but do not overuse them; focus on making the content accessible and relatable. Give the reader references to the CCC for deeper study.
    *   Prioritize getting the core substance and flow down. Do not overly focus on perfect grammar, style, or formatting at this stage; the goal is a complete initial version of the content for each section.
    *   Use the following markers to indicate progress:
        *   []   - When the section is not yet started.
        *   [] - When the section file is complete and ready for review.

## Output
A comprehensive set of individual files, each containing the first draft content for one specific section/chapter of the book, ready for subsequent human review and revision.
