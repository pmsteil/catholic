**First Draft Writing Plan: Outline to Section Files**

**Objective:** Systematically generate the complete first draft of the book by expanding the provided outline into individual document files for every designated section.

**Input:** A detailed Book Outline (`book1-outline_gemini_25_final.md`) that includes all major sections and chapters. Specific writing guidelines are provided below.

**Writing Guidelines:**

*   **Writing Style Reference:** Base the writing style, tone, and approach on the provided `book1-blogpost-for-catholics.md`. Incorporate relevant content, examples, and anecdotes from this blog post where appropriate throughout the draft.
*   **Core Purpose:** To help everyday Catholic Christians deepen their understanding and practice of authentic love, grounded in the unity of truth, justice, and mercy, as revealed through Scripture and Tradition. This book aims to equip Catholics to live their faith more fully and engage confidently with contemporary cultural challenges.
*   **Target Audience:** Catholics who experience the Love of Christ daily but seek a better way to understand, teach, and help our culture realize God's plan for true Love and Salvation from societal injustice. Assumes basic familiarity with Catholic concepts but avoids overly academic jargon. The goal is to be accessible, relatable, and inspiring for the average parishioner.
*   **Desired Tone:** Personal, direct, urgent, relatable, and passionately evangelistic/apologetic (similar to the `book1-blogpost-for-catholics.md`). Use "we" and "us" frequently to connect with the reader. Incorporate personal anecdotes (marked with placeholders like `[Author Anecdote: ...]`) to illustrate points. Maintain a sense of hope and confidence in the beauty and truth of the Catholic faith.
*   **Central Definition of Love (Integrate Throughout):**

    > **Perfect Love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and true mercy into life-giving communion.**
    > _(Shorter form: Love is the unity of God's true justice and true mercy.)_

    *   **Breakdown:** Explicitly break down _each_ component (sacred, sacrificial, gift, covenant, binds, true justice, true mercy, life-giving, communion) in Chapter 3.
    *   **Application:** Consistently use this definition as a lens to analyze topics in Parts II and III. Regularly ask variations of: "How does this teaching/sacrament/virtue reveal the _sacred/sacrificial/covenantal/binding/truth/justice/mercy/life-giving/communion_ aspect of God's love?" Use blockquotes for emphasis on this definition when reintroduced.
*   **Key Themes to Emphasize:**

    *   The possibility and necessity of objective truth rooted in God (address early).
    *   The innate human intuition for justice and mercy as signposts to God.
    *   The integration of truth, justice, and mercy as essential for authentic love.
    *   The family as the "first school of love" and its societal importance.
    *   Critique of modern ideologies (Wokeism, Relativism, Individualism, etc.) through the lens of the core definition of love (consider Appendix).
    *   The sacraments, prayer, and virtue as essential means of encountering and living God's love.
    *   The call to personal holiness and its connection to evangelization.
    *   Practical application and actionable steps for readers via "Practice & Habit" sections.
*   **Structural Notes:**

    *   Maintain the three-part structure (Problem/Promise, Foundation, Action).
    *   Incorporate insights and specific examples from `book1-blogpost-for-catholics.md`.
    *   Include "Practice & Habit" sections after each chapter's reflection questions.
    *   Use formatting (blockquotes `>`) for emphasis on key definitions, tips, or sidebars.
    *   Integrate the TODO scriptures from the original outline where appropriate.
    *   Add explicit Appendix placeholders at the end.
    *   Highlight the Eucharist at the start of Part II.

**Procedure:**

1.  **File Structure Setup:** Based on the `book1-outline_gemini_25_final.md` outline, create the following separate document files (using `.md` format unless otherwise specified) and as you complete each file, mark it as completed with a green checkmark (✅):
    *   `book1_00_About_This_Book.md`
    *   ✅ - `book1_01_Book_Purpose.md`
    *   ✅ - `book1_02_Introduction.md`
    *   ✅ - `book1_Part1_Header.md` (For "PART I: THE PROBLEM AND THE PROMISE" intro text, if any)
    *   ✅ - `book1_Ch01_Sounding_Good_vs_Being_Good.md`
    *   ✅ - `book1_Ch02_That_Little_Voice_Inside.md`

    *   ✅ - `book1_Ch05_Seeing_Clearly_Truth.md`

    *   ✅ - `book1_Ch10_Commandments_Guardrails.md`
    *   ✅ - `book1_Ch11_Beyond_Rules_Virtue.md`
    *   ✅ - `book1_Ch12_Plugging_In_Sacraments_Prayer.md`
    *   ✅ - `book1_Ch13_Love_Starts_Here_Family.md`
    *   ✅ - `book1_Ch14_Answering_the_Call_Sainthood.md`
    *   ✅ - `book1_Ch15_Adventure_Continues.md`
    *   ✅ - `book1_Afterword.md`
    *   ✅ - `book1_Appendix_A_Love_vs_Counterfeits.md`
    *   ✅ - `book1_Appendix_B_Tools_for_Formation.md`
2.  **Section-by-Section Drafting:**
    *   Select the next section/chapter to work on. Before you mark that section/chapter complete, make sure the file was created successfully and has all the content you intended.
    *   Consult the corresponding points for that specific section within the Book Outline.
    *   Write the initial draft content for that section directly into its dedicated file, using the outline points as a structural guide and checklist.
    *   Focus on translating outline points into prose, developing ideas, elaborating on concepts, building narrative or arguments, and ensuring all planned topics for the section are addressed.
    *   Prioritize getting the core substance and flow down. Do not overly focus on perfect grammar, style, or formatting at this stage; the goal is a complete initial version of the content for each section.
3.  **Sequential Completion:** Progress through the outline, drafting the content for each section in its respective file until all outlined components have a corresponding first draft document.

**Output:** A comprehensive set of individual files, each containing the first draft content for one specific section of the book, ready for subsequent review and revision.
