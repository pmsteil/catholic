# Writing a Book Draft from Outline

## Objective

Systematically generate the complete first draft of this book by expanding the provided outline into individual markdown files for every designated part/chapter.

## Input:

A detailed Book Outline (`book1_v2_outline.md`) that includes all major parts and chapters. Specific writing guidelines are provided below.

## Writing Style and Guidelines

1.  **Writing Style Reference:** Use the provided `book1-blogpost-for-catholics.md` as a reference for writing style, tone, and approach. Incorporate relevant content, examples, and anecdotes from this blog post where appropriate throughout the draft.
2.  **Core Purpose:** To help everyday Catholic Christians deepen their understanding, digestion, and practice of authentic love (grounded in the unity of truth, justice, and mercy), enabling them to love their Lord more deeply and be a light in the darkness of society. The book should equip Catholics to become laser-focused in the practice of their faith, engage confidently with contemporary cultural challenges, and implicitly demonstrate how true faith works through love (countering "faith alone" narratives).
3.  **Desired Tone:** Personal, direct, urgent, relatable, and passionately evangelistic/apologetic (similar to the `book1-blogpost-for-catholics.md`). Use "we" and "us" frequently to connect with the reader. Incorporate personal anecdotes (marked with placeholders like `[Author Anecdote: ...]`) to illustrate points. Maintain a sense of hope and confidence in the beauty and truth of the Catholic faith.
4.  **Narrative Flow and Cohesion:** Maintain awareness of the overall book structure outlined in `book1_v2_outline.md`. Ensure smooth transitions between chapters, building upon previous concepts without unnecessary repetition. Each chapter should contribute to the book's progressive argument and narrative arc.
5.  **Central Definition of Love (Integrate Throughout):**

    > **Perfect Love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and true mercy into life-giving communion.**
    > _(Shorter form: Love is the unity of God's true justice and true mercy.)_

    *   **Breakdown:** Explicitly break down _each_ component (sacred, sacrificial, gift, covenant, binds, true justice, true mercy, life-giving, communion) in the chapter defining love (currently Ch 14).
    *   **Application:** Consistently use this definition as a lens to analyze topics in every chapter. Regularly ask variations of: "How does this teaching/sacrament/virtue reveal the _sacred/sacrificial/covenantal/binding/truth/justice/mercy/life-giving/communion_ aspect of God's love?" Use blockquotes for emphasis on this definition when reintroduced.

6.  **Chapter Structure (Narrative with Devotional Elements):** Each chapter should follow this structure:
    *   **Opening:**
        *   Start with a relevant **Key Scripture Verse**.
        *   Follow with a relevant **Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) Paragraph**.
    *   **Body:**
        *   Develop the chapter's theme based on the outline points, using the narrative style and tone defined above.
        *   Integrate other relevant Scripture and CCC references naturally within the text where needed to support points.
        *   Include placeholders for personal anecdotes (`[Author Anecdote: ...]`).
    *   **Closing:**
        *   **Chapter Takeaway:** A concise summary of the chapter's main point.
        *   **Reflection Question:** One deep, thought-provoking question related to the chapter's theme for personal reflection.
        *   **Further Study - Scripture:** List a few additional relevant Scripture references.
        *   **Further Study - Catechism:** List a few additional relevant CCC paragraph numbers.
        *   **Prayer Practice:** Suggest a fitting Catholic devotional practice (e.g., a specific Rosary mystery, a Litany, Act of Contrition/Faith/Hope/Love, prayer to the Holy Spirit, prayer to a relevant saint) explicitly linking the chapter's theme to the prayer's intention (e.g., understanding the theme more deeply, praying for the Salvation of the World).

## File Structure and Drafting Process

1.  **File Structure Setup:** Based on the `book1_v2_outline.md` outline, create the necessary separate document files (using `.md` format) in the `./book1_v2/` directory. Use a clear naming convention (e.g., `01_Part1_Header.md`, `02_Ch01_The_Problem.md`).
2.  **Part-by-Part Drafting:**
    *   Select the next incomplete part/chapter file to work on.
    *   Consult the corresponding points for that specific part within the Book Outline (`book1_v2_outline.md`).
    *   Write the initial draft content for that part directly into its dedicated file, following the **Chapter Structure** guidelines above.
    *   Focus on translating outline points into prose, developing ideas, elaborating on concepts, building narrative or arguments, and ensuring all planned topics for the part are addressed.
    *   Use the provided `book1-blogpost-for-catholics.md` as a reference for style and content, integrating relevant examples and anecdotes.
    *   Ensure the content is engaging, accessible, and relatable to the target audience.
    *   Use the core definition of love as a lens throughout.
    *   Use the following formatting conventions:
        *   Use blockquotes for key definitions, Scripture/CCC openings, takeaways, or sidebars.
        *   Use headings (e.g., `## Chapter Takeaway`, `### Reflection Question`) to structure the content clearly.
        *   Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity where appropriate.
    *   Use placeholders for personal anecdotes (e.g., `[Author Anecdote: ...]`).
    *   Ensure each part/chapter file is comprehensive, covering all points in the outline for that part.
    *   Prioritize getting the core substance and flow down. Do not overly focus on perfect grammar, style, or formatting at this stage; the goal is a complete initial version of the content for each part.

## Output

A comprehensive set of individual files, each containing the first draft content for one specific part/chapter of the book according to the specified structure, ready for subsequent human review and revision.
