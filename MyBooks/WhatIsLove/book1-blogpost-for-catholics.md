# **Made for Love: A Catholics' Blueprint for Unity in a Divided World**

## Introduction

### God is Love

When I was 19, on a church retreat at the "Emmaus" retreat center in Panama, God taught me His first lesson that I have never stopped thinking about:

> "God is love, and whoever remains in love remains in God and God in him." (1 John 4:16).

"God is Love".  Wow - amazing... That one statement changed my entire life.  But it also raised an important question:  "What does that mean that 'God is Love'?" I intuitively felt this truth deep within me, but I also knew that I didn't have a full understandding.

Now, 37 years later, through so much learning, studying, thinking, teaching and talking - God, through His Church, has helped me bring it all together into a clear, concise, and simple understanding of what love is.

Also, I have studied deeply the "sola fide" ("by faith alone") controversy that still divides so many in the Christian world. This has forced me to see the relationship between faith, love, truth and salvation that seems to make it all make sense.

And why is this important?  Or "How important is it that we understand this"?

It seems to me THIS IS THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL question of this age - "What is love?".

It seems obvious to me that the biggest problem in the world today is that as a society, we no longer know what love is. I daresay most Christians probably cannot explain what love is...

### Can we know objective truth?

When I was a "youth pastor" I asked my kids one night - "Is it possible to know objectively - for certain - what is evil and what is good?" - out of the 15 present that night, 13 said "No" - 1 wasn't sure and 1 said "Yes" - we can know from the Bible. These were GOOD Church kids!  But they are swimming in the post-modern, post-Christian, liberal waters in our society that are telling them THERE IS NO OBJECTIVE TRUTH! And they believe it!  This led me to teach a lesson series on "What is Truth"... and it changed my whole life.

I realized that if these kids (the next generation!) believe there is no objective truth, then for them, there will be no such thing as God, love, truth, faith, morality, justice, mercy, or anything else.  And all of society is doomed to fall apart.

THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM! And it seems to me, that this is what is plaguing the world today - a lack of objective truth. As Christians, what is our answer to this?  Simply that Jesus died on the cross for our sins?  In a post-truth world, this is too big of a leap of faith.

But wait, don't we believe in a God that Created the entire Universe?  Isn't that God the author of all truth?

> "Indeed my mouth utters truth, and my lips abhor wickedness" (Proverbs 8:7).

### Foundational Truths of Humanity

And so, it seems to me that we need to go back to basics, back to showing that if God is the author of all truth, he will be found everywhere.  He will be found in the moral truths that we know deep within us.

We need to teach that there IS objective truth and that it can be known and that it can ONLY be known with God as its author. Otherwise, any seeking of love, justice or mercy is futile, empty and devoid of logic.

So let us explore this.

First, let's examine the claim that "there is no objective truth" - in order to make THAT truth claim that "there is no objective truth" - one first must be able to make a claim of truth.  So not only is it self-refuting and illogical, but more imporantly, it points out another truth about human reasonsing - even one making this claim, takes for granted that they can use their intellect and reason to come to a conclusion.  Isn't that a basic truth of humanity? That we have a capacity to reason and identify claims of truth or falsehood? To recognize reality as we see it?

Hmm, are there are any other truths of humanity that we can know?  Of course - there are many, but for this article let us focus on this example.

What if a stranger was arrested for the murder of a baby. No one has to teach us that murder is inherently evil, we feel this deeply - why?  Because ALL HUMAN BEINGS understand these basic MORAL truths:

1. Human dignity - that the baby is a person with dignity and inherent value and no one, except their Creator has the right to take their life.
2. Love - that the baby is loved and will be deeply mourned by their family.
3. Justice - that the baby did not deserve to die needlessly, and that punishment is due to the person who took their life.

I would submit to you that these are not intellectual claims, nor ideas that some might say need "propping" up by religion in order to be true - rather these are TRUTHS that are deeply rooted in the human heart. These are "spiritual" truths (they don't exist anywere in a physical, object form) but we know them to be 'objectively' true.

### Truth, Justice and Mercy in the United States Constitution

And by the way, there is one more truth that we can know from these, that if we believe that these three are true, then the one who is accused of the murder also is a human being, who, if guilty, has sinned and must pay for the consequences of his sin, but also that the accused deserves certain mercies.

In the United States anyway, that it may not serve JUSTICE to simply enact revenge on this person.  That if someone points their finger and accuses one of the heinous crime, we do not allow "vigilante justice" for fear that the accused may be innocent which means that justice will NOT have been served.

No, instead we submit ourselves to the US Constitution and Bill of Rights which recognizes a fundamental truth (which by the way only holds true in a Christian worldview) about Human beings:

> "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed, by their Creator, with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

And so, the accused deserves to be arrested, charged, presumed innocent until proven guilty, that he deserves a fair and speedy trial, and that he deserves a trial by jury of his peers.  All of these are acts of mercy on the accused to ensure that JUSTICE is properly served and that even the accused is treated with dignity and rights that are inherent to human beings.

### The Heart of Moral Truths

And so, the point is, we CAN know Truth.  Truth explains the reality that we find ourselves in.  Truth is that which reflects who we are and how we were created.  The moral truths we have looked at are truths - "moral truths" - that are deeply rooted in the human heart.

Christians recognize and believe that all Truths come from the Creator of all things - God - and so it would make sense that our Faith would teach us about these Truths.

And SO IT DOES!  The Catholic Faith goes deep into the heart of these truths - and the Church has been teaching them for centuries!

And from studying the Bible and the Catholic tradition, it seems clear to me now that these moral truths and the most critical truths that the Christian religion teaches are intertwined and interrelated to the "heart" of all Truths - that God is Love.

It seems that the Catholic Church has also been working hard to help define what is meant by "God is Love" through the centuries.

Here is what God has led me to... a definition that I believe is what the Church has been teaching all along:

> Perfect Love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and mercy into life-giving communion.

Wow - that is a mouthful - it is a deeply packed definition - every word was carefully chosen to try to capture the "heart", the core of what love is... said more simply:

> Love is the unity of God's true justice, and mercy.

In other words, the way we know we are doing love correctly, the way we "do love" is to look to God to learn about His perfect justice and His perfect mercy and then pray for the Wisdom to know how to unify these into every relationship and interaction we have - starting with God and then eminating out to our "neighbor".

Quick example to illustrate my point. Every good father knows that he must teach his children right from wrong.  Does he do this by beating his five year old "mercilessly" every time he tells a lie? - Of course not this is justice without mercy.  Well, does he do this by allowing his child to do lie over and over in order to support the child's 'freedom' or 'happiness'? Of course not, this is mercy without justice.

His child - his own creation deserves much better.  The child is literally created in the parents own image - he deserves to be taught what is right from wrong (justice) in a way that is appropriate to his age and development (mercy) so that he can grow up to be someone who can use his gifts, talents and abilities to make the world a better place (i.e. to "love").  He does not deserve to end up in prison or strung out on drugs, or in multiple failed marriages with custody battle chaos.  Parents intuitively know they want what is best for their child, but many struggle because they do not know what love is.

And so - what is the goal of parenting?  To love their children deeply and to teach their child how to love. So through their example, they demonstrate a proper balance of justice and mercy in all things.  A reward for a job well done - that is proper justice. Forgiving them for a wrong they committed, that is proper mercy.  Administering discipline effectively but proper to their age, development, etc is a proper balancing of justice and mercy.

The family is SO important here - because it is the FIRST and most IMPORTANT teacher of love! But if the parents don't know what love is - if they are not deeply rooted in God's Truth about His Justice and Mercy, they might have a diminished ability to love and teach love properly.

### Our own family

As "well meaning Christian parents" we never really knew what our goal was with our children.  I knew that discipline was important, but mostly because my father was pretty strict with discipline.  I don't think he knew the goal either (he was not a good man, a good Father, but not a devout Christian until later in life).  You feel it somewhat intuitively, but when you put these words to it, it makes so much sense.

And the ramifications of a poor family life that has little regard for either justice or mercy are endless - divorce, children split between parents, abuse of children as well as substance abuse and so much more "broken families" and turmoil - I maintain that most all of this is caused by ignorance of and imbalances of God's justice and mercy and the role they play in the family.

And now with the advent of social media, our children are exposed to all manners of incorrect teaching. Liberalism, relativism, post-modernism, materialism, trans-genderism - they are all over the internet and our children are learning from them!  And so we need to be able to teach our children - and all that we come in contact with about the transformative power behind God's love (and we must know what that means of course).

> This article is a summary of a book I am working on called "What is Love?, The Heart of the Gospel for Catholics".  In that book I will go into much greater detail to lay out the biblical foundation for the Catholic understanding of love as well as showing how the depth of Catholic teaching teaches us how to Love God and our neighbor properly.

Liberalism, post-modernism, marxism, feminism, materialism, gender ideology, and LGBTQ+ advocacy ALL have similar flaws - they start with some flawed truth about humanity and then try to enact some skewed ideas of justice or mercy based on that flawed truth. There is no firm foundation for any of these ideologies.

They are all "looking for love in all the wrong places" – conducting failed experiments in human flourishing without the Christian model that perfectly integrates truth, justice, and mercy.

The evidence surrounds us: these approaches lead to mental and spiritual confusion, destruction, and ultimately death – both spiritual and physical.

But here is the beautiful thing. We have an "in" to start a discussion with anyone caught up in these ideologies - and even the athiest or agnostic.  They all recognize and yearn for truth, justice and mercy!  This is what they all want!

For example, we hear cries of "Black lives matter!", "No justice, No Peace", "Silence is violence", "My body, my choice", "Equal pay for equal work", "Trans rights are human rights".

Overlooking "what" they are advocating for, let us realize that these are all cries for justice!  And as Christians, we have a very easy question we can ask them

> Are you seeking perfect justice or imperfect justice?

That opens the door to a conversation about - "What is justice"? "Does it need to be properly tempered with mercy"? "Are we fighting for justice at the expense of others, or justice for all"?

This is just a taste, but you probably already see the point...

And so, as members of the Body of Christ, we have a sacred and moral responsibility to LEARN, UNDERSTAND and SHARE the Catholic integrated vision of love and then to bring it into every corner of our society. Jesus calls us to be the light of the world and the salt of the earth.  Let us proclaim the "good news" of God's definition of love and Jesus' example to show us how to live it out SACRIFICALLY.

The "good news" is that the Catholic Church teaching of the faith - as it has been handed down to us from Jesus, through the Apostles - teaches that Love is at the heart of the Gospel:

> There was a scholar of the law who stood up to test him and said, "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?" Jesus said to him, "What is written in the law? How do you read it?" He said in reply, "You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your being, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself." He replied to him, "You have answered correctly; do this and you will live." (Luke 10:25-28, NABRE)

And Jesus also said:

> Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets. I have not come to abolish but to fulfill.
> -- (Matthew 5:17, NABRE)

And Paul tells us:

> Love does no evil to the neighbor; hence, love is the fulfillment of the law. (Romans 13:10, NABRE)

and

> If I speak in human and angelic tongues but do not have love, I am a resounding gong or a clashing cymbal. And if I have the gift of prophecy and comprehend all mysteries and all knowledge; if I have all faith so as to move mountains but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give away everything I own, and if I hand my body over so that I may boast but do not have love, I gain nothing. (1 Corinthians 13:1-3, NABRE)

and

> So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love. (1 Corinthians 13:13, NABRE)


### The Gospel

Some say that the Gospel is simply that Jesus died on the Cross so that you can go to Heaven.  But the Gospel is so much more than that!  The entire Bible and Jesus' life, ministry, death, resurrection and ascension are all continually teaching us that Love is the heart of the Gospel and that:

> Perfect Love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and mercy into life-giving communion.

That God is Truth.
That God is Justice.
That God is Mercy.
That God is Love.

In the rest of this article, I just want to touch on the highlights of Catholic teaching on these topics. The Catholic faith is so rich and deep and I pray that this will spur you to want to go deeper in learning your faith, so that you can teach it to others (after all that is what Jesus asked the very first members of His church to do in Matthew 28:18-20 - "teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you")

## First some definitions per the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC)

### Truth

Pope St. John Paul II in his encyclical "[Veritatis splendor](https://https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_06081993_veritatis-splendor.html)" gives a wonderul preliminary definition we can work with:

> The splendour of truth shines forth in all the works of the Creator and, in a special way, in man, created in the image and likeness of God (cf. Gen 1:26). Truth enlightens man's intelligence and shapes his freedom, leading him to know and love the Lord. Hence the Psalmist prays: "Let the light of your face shine on us, O Lord" (Ps 4:6).

Truth is at is core is the alignment of our thoughts with all of reality (not just the Bible) as it so beautifully describes in the Catechsim paragraph 2500:

> But truth can also find other complementary forms of human expression, above all when it is a matter of evoking what is beyond words: the depths of the human heart, the exaltations of the soul, the mystery of God. Even before revealing himself to man in words of truth, God reveals himself to him through the universal language of creation, the work of his Word, of his wisdom: the order and harmony of the cosmos—which both the child and the scientist discover—'from the greatness and beauty of created things comes a corresponding perception of their Creator,' 'for the author of beauty created them.'"
>
> --- CCC 2500

In other words, God created us with the gift of intellect so that we might be able to recognize His Truth in the reality that we live in.  We must use that intellect to discern what is good, true and beautiful - to recognize His "revelation" to us - AND THE CHURCH HAS! For 2000 years of those following Christ and at least another 4000 years before that, in the Jewish people, men have been using their intellect to uncover "Truth" given to us by our Creator.  The Catholic teachings of the truth of faith, hope, charity, justice, mercy, virtues and so much more help us understand love as deeply as we need to go.

And so then, if anyone desires ACTUAl justice and actual MERCY, they must look for "true" justice and "true" mercy.  Justice and Mercy - rooted in "Truth" - that comes from our Creator, not simply by human intellect alone - and certainly not from human "opinion" from very unwise people.

### Justice

> Justice is the moral virtue that consists in the constant and firm will to give their due to God and neighbor. Justice toward God is called the "virtue of religion". Justice toward men disposes one to respect the rights of each and to establish in human relationships the harmony that promotes equity with regard to person and to the common good. The just man, often mentioned in the Sacred Scriptures, is distinguished by habitual right thinking and the uprightness of his conduct toward his neighbor... (from CCC 1807)

This works in two ways: we should treat others with the proper dignity and respect they deserve as human beings, and we must also accept that our own actions have consequences, including punishment when we do wrong.

### Mercy

I love John Paul II's encyclical "Dives in Misericordia" (Rich in Mercy):

Mercy is "love's second name" and the "specific manner in which love is revealed and effected vis-à-vis the reality of the evil that is in the world." And also Mercy represents "a special power of love, which prevails over the sin and infidelity of the chosen people."

CCC 270 tells us that God's Mercy is infinite. Think of this - the all-powerful Creator of the Universe has shown us that He will not condemn us for our sins, but He will forgive us and give us a second chance if we choose to repent from our disordered senses of justice and mercy and learn to love more like Him.

Mercy is how God responds with compassion when we suffer or sin, and giving us the example that we too should forgive others for the sake of peace and communion in all our relationships. (CCC 1422, 2840)

And here is where the Catechism gets real: CCC 2840

> Now - and this is daunting - this outpouring of mercy cannot penetrate our hearts as long as we have not forgiven those who have trespassed against us. Love, like the Body of Christ, is indivisible; we cannot love the God we cannot see if we do not love the brother or sister we do see. In refusing to forgive our brothers and sisters, our hearts are closed and their hardness makes them impervious to the Father's merciful love; but in confessing our sins, our hearts are opened to his grace.

Again, our moral intution shows us that when we wrong others, we desire mercy - we desire forgiveness - why?  In order to be "reconciled" to them.  And when others wrong us, it is a high act of sacrifice to forgive - and why - we may also want reconciliation and at minimum, we don't want their wrong to have a hold onto us and turn into bitterness and resentment which will turn into more evil.

## Love: The Heart of "The Gospel"

Now with those definitions in mind, let us look at "love".  At the center of our faith lies a profound understanding of love that goes far beyond what our culture typically recognizes. While the world often reduces love to emotional attachment or temporary union, our tradition offers something much deeper. Here is a deeply packed definition of love:

> Perfect love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and mercy into life-giving communion.

This definition, rooted in Scripture and Church teaching, reveals why the Catholic vision of love is so transformative. Each word is deeply packed with meaning:

- **Sacred**: Love flows from God Himself — "God is love" (1 John 4:8). It is the highest need we have and the highest gift we can give.
- **Sacrificial**: Following Christ's example, authentic love requires sacrifice — "No one has greater love than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends" (John 15:13).
- **binds**: We must be bound by (submit our will to) truth, justice, and mercy in God's wisdom, not our own.
- **Covenant**: Love establishes permanent familial relationships with mutual obligations, respect, honor and care for the common good.
- **true**: Love depends on reality as defined by the Creator, if it doesn't line up with who we are as human beings, then it isn't leading us to love.
- **Justice**: Love gives God and each person their "due" according to their God-given dignity, rights and responsibilities.
- **Mercy**: Love responds to brokenness with healing. Mercy heals through the gift of unmerited forgiveness to those who have wronged us.
- **Life-giving**: Love properly lived out transforms us to be more like Christ - selfless, patient, kind, obedient, merciful, just, sacrificial, etc.  This transforms us and the world around us. Mother Theresa said: "If you want to change the world, go home and love your family."
- **Communion**: Love creates unity with God and others — "That they may all be one" (John 17:21). We all crave to be held in a community of love, and we all long to be loved. But love requires work.  See CCC 270 which says: "The love of God and of our neighbor is the foundation of all human conduct."

This integrated understanding of love provides us with a powerful framework for both deepening our own faith and evangelizing in today's world.

Note that without on objective reality that is ordered by a loving Creator, love has no meaning, boundaries or purpose other than self-gratification and preservation of the species - we are relegated then to nothing more than animals and anything goes.
We know deeply that love has rules because even the 100% non-religous feels the pain of betrayal, unfaithfulness, and the need for loyalty in love.

## The Trinity: Perfect Love in Communion

Taking everything I described above together, and we begin to approach our limited understanding of the Most Holy Trinity—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in perfect communion. The Trinity reveals that love is not merely what God is, but that it is what he **does**. This eternal exchange of love within the Godhead shows us that authentic love is always active, relational, self-giving, and life-generating.

Holy Communion is our participation in this Trinitarian communion!

> "The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? Because the loaf of bread is one, we, though many, are one body, for we all partake of the one loaf." (1 Corinthians 10:16-17, NABRE)

> "Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him on the last day. For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him." (John 6:54-56, NABRE)

The Eucharist is the supreme example of love as the **sacred**, **sacrificial** **gift** that established His **New Covenant** with us, upholds **truth** and **justice**, extends **mercy**, and creates **communion**.

This is why the Eucharist is the source and summit of our Faith. It is our God's supreme example of where truth, justice, mercy, and love are all in perfect communion. And we have been given the gift of experience this perfect love in the Eucharist every day that we can get to Mass!

## How do we know how to love?

So, to reiterate. Love is that state where justice and mercy are truly balanced according to God's Wisdom. This is one huge reason why Jesus started a Church - so that this collective wisdom can be handed down from one generation to the next.  The Catechism of the Catholic Church is an overlooked and beautiful collection of this colletive wisdom.

If you want to know how to love correctly - know the Catechism!

But even if you don't looking at every moral dilemma through the eyes of "How do we apply God's justice and mercy in this situation" will get you quite far.

## The Foundational Principles

As we have noticed, one way to know that God exists is to see the moral truths of love, justice, mercy, and truth in our hearts. That the moral law is written in our hearts is a beautiful example of the truth that we are made in the image of God. And so God is the Creator of all Truth, Justice and Mercy - of love.

And so, God's revelation has taught us these foundation principles:

1. Every human being is made in the image of God and has inherent worth.
2. Covenant - all morality must be ordered toward what is truly good for the individual, family and community (in that order).
3. Human beings are ordered toward love - to turn away from injustice and hardness of heart - and submit our will to God's Wisdom of how to love.
4. To love God or our neighbor deeply, we must live in a way that upholds and honors God's ideas of truth, justice, mercy.

These principles (and their implications) summon us to willingly surrender our moral understanding and shape how we live our lives. They call us to **freely bind** ourselves to God's design for how we educate and raise our children, treat our neighbors, care for the poor and oppressed, and establish laws and policies.

As Catholics we must not separate "church" and "state" when it comes to establishing laws and policies since most laws and policies have moral implications and require us to consider the moral principles I outlined above.

We don't need the government to be Catholic, but we can and should bring our Catholic Faith into government and demonstrate that when we voluntarily bind ourselves to these truths, we are able to achieve the Declaration of Independence's recognition that all people are "endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."

These God-given rights can only be properly understood and protected when we acknowledge their divine origin and purpose. When we freely bind ourselves to God's moral law, we discover true freedom - not the license to do whatever we want, but the freedom to do what we ought, to pursue virtue, and to build a society that respects the dignity of every human person from conception to natural death.

## Responding to Modern Challenges

And so, in light of our new definition of love:

> Perfect love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and mercy into life-giving communion.

I would say that modern secular ideologies are actually attempting to achieve the same end - a society that is ordered toward the common good - but they are often missing some key ingredient of love. Let us do a quick review of modern ideologies to see where and why they miss the mark:

- **Postmodernism** claims that there is no objective truth, rendering authentic love ordered toward anything "good" impossible. There is nothing good, no justice, no mercy, no truth.
- **Relativism** claims there is no objective truth, rendering authentic love ordered toward anything "good" impossible. "My Truth" is no truth.
- **Liberalism** emphasizes man's desire to establish moral law without an objective truth and so easily distorts the truth of how human beings were made.
- **Individualism** prioritizes personal autonomy over covenant relationships. We are all born by and into a family, we are raised and exist in 'community' (note the ideas of 'communion' and 'unity' embedded in the word). We are members of the Body of Christ, the household of God, the Kingdom - not just autonomous individuals. Nothing we do is in isolation.
- **Sentimentalism** reduces love to feelings, often separated from truth, commitment or mercy. Convinces people to stay in broken relationships even when when justice and mercy has been violated.
- **Marxism** emphasizes a human beings need for power in order to achieve a better society.  Completely devoid of truth of how human beings were made.
- **Critical Theory** - claims that all human knowledge is a social construct and should be rejected in favor of 'critical' analysis. Causes a disconnect between mind and body which furthers any mental or emotional problems.
- **Feminism** emphasizes equility between men and women, ignoring the beauty and complementarity of the male and female. Justice at the expense of truth.
- **intersectionality** - divides people into groups based on their identity and then claims that these groups have different truths and needs for justice and mercy. It eventually breaks down all the groups down into an individual and never considers that we exist in community.
- **Gender ideology** claims that gender is a social construct, not a biological reality. Causes a disconnect between mind and body which furthers any mental or emotional problems. Truth that we all come from a Creator and are made in his image are cast aside in order to elevate human needs for attention and desires of the flesh to the point of 'God'.
- **Wokeism** emphasizes justice for the oppressed, but often divorced from truth or what is just for the entire community. Wokeism is directly influenced by 'critical theory', 'intersectionality', and Marxism all of which are rooted in the same idea that as human beings we can define our own truth and morals.

All of these broken ideologies have led to the fragmentation of society (opposite of unity and communion) and the breakdown of the family:

- **Divorce**: literally breaks up the unity of the family and devastates the children who then learn from this broken example of love and live that out.
- **Abortion**: literally murders innocent babies for the sake of convenience and selfishness.
- **Gay marriage**: distorts the model of what marriage is - a union between a man and a woman ordered toward the procreation and proper education of children. And dismisses the truth that men and women are complementary.
- **Transgenderism**: teaches children that they were not made in God's image - they can define their own truth all the way down to redefining their own gender. But a Truth that can never actually be realized is not Truth.  This ideology pulls the rug out from under the family and distorts truth, justice and mercy.

When evangelizing or discussing contemporary issues, we can explain that the Catholic vision offers a more complete alternative:

1. **On human dignity**: Catholic teaching upholds the inherent worth of every person from conception to natural death, not because of the color of their skin, what they do or contribute, but because they are created in God's image. All discussions of justice and mercy must start with this premise!
2. **On social justice**: Catholic teaching pursues justice grounded in truth and tempered by mercy, recognizing that authentic justice establishes right relationships for all rather than merely redistributing power, wealth, or status. It is never justice for you if it is not justice for your neighbor.
3. **On marriage and family**: Catholic teaching defends the covenant of marriage and the family as the domestic church where love, truth, justice, and mercy are first learned and lived. A healthy family is the foundation of a healthy society.
4. **On moral issues**: We uphold moral teachings not as arbitrary rules but as expressions of love that protect human dignity, establish justice and offer mercy - all according to God's perfect wisdom as has been revealed in Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition.

## Living This Vision in Daily Life

For us as practicing Catholics, this understanding of love transforms how we approach our daily lives:

### In Our Prayer Life

The integrated vision of love deepens our prayer beyond routine:

- In the **Holy Eucharist**, we re-encounter our covenantal, sacrificial gift of communion with Jesus Himself, the perfect unity of truth, love, justice, and mercy.
- In the **Sacrament of Reconciliation**, we experience God's justice and His mercy.
- In praying the **Rosary**, we contemplate how Mary's fiat ("Let it be done unto me according to your word") exemplifies sacrificial covenant love.
- In all the sacraments, sacramentals, devotionals and prayers - we grow in wisdom, learning and living love of Jesus and our neighbor.

### In Our Families

As the "domestic church," our families become schools of integrated love:

- Parents teach truth by their example and fidelity to Church teaching and participating in the sacraments.
- Family rules and discipline reflect justice that respects each person's dignity.
- Forgiveness within the family models mercy that heals rather than enables.
- Family prayer and attending Mass together fosters communion with God and each other.
- This gives parents direction on how to properly love their children. By learning and teaching the children how to balance justice, mercy and truth.
- We have a clear roadmap for helping our children "become saints". Teach them how to love.

### In Our Evangelization

When sharing our faith with others, this understanding of love provides a compelling message:

- When sharing with non-practicing Catholics, we can help teach them the beauty of the Catholic understanding of love.
- When sharing with non-Catholic Christians, we can help them understand that truth, justice and mercy are not just Christian values, but they are the foundation of all human dignity and flourishing. And that we can easily then show why "faith working through love" is what makes us Christian. That "faith" and "works" are not separate, but are in fact one thing: love.
- When sharing with non-Christians, we can approach the discussion of God and religion from purely foundational principles of truth, justice and mercy which they almost certainly already "believe in".
- Bottom line - lead with love - but know what love is...
- And in all things charity - why? Because we respect and honor every human being as a person created in the image of God.

### In Political Issues

- When addressing difficult moral issues, we have a framework to show how God's wisdom can be applied.  What is the truth of the matter?  What justice is required?  What mercy is needed? How should these be balanced for the good of all?
- When looking at political candidates, we can evaluate their policies and positions based on the principles of their understanding of God's truth, justice, and mercy.

## The Cross: Love's Perfect Expression

At the heart of our Catholic faith stands the Cross — Jesus' ultimate sacrifice as an expression of love as the perfect integration of truth, justice, and mercy. On Calvary, we see:

- The **truth** about sin's gravity and the punishment we deserve
- The **justice** that sin requires, fully satisfied
- The **mercy** that offers forgiveness and healing
- The **covenant** established in Christ's blood
- The **communion** made possible through His sacrifice

When we venerate the Cross or participate in the Mass, we enter into this mystery of integrated love. And when we carry our own crosses in union with Christ, we participate in His redemptive love.

This is what it means to pick up your cross and follow Jesus - to pick up the Cross of truth, justice, mercy and sacrifice and then live it out in your daily life. The more deeply we are able to do this, the more we become "salt of the earth and light of the world" (Matthew 5:13-14), joining Jesus in His mission of Salvation for the entire world.

## Practical Steps for Growth

Start by meditating on this definition:

> Perfect love is the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and mercy into life-giving communion.

Memorize it, internalize it, be able to explain it.

As Catholics - Jesus' beautiful Church, led by the Holy Spirit, has given us so many beautiful gifts to experience the wisdom and love of God first hand!

1. **Pray the Mass**: Mass is our highest form of prayer. Learn about the why behind everything that is done at the Mass and what it has to teach you about God's love, truth, justice, and mercy.
2. **Liturgy of the Hours** - Pray the Liturgy of the Hours daily.  This is another form of prayer and immersing yourself in God's Word.  Pray with someone else to help grow in wisdom and understanding and to hold each other accountable.
3. **Receive the sacraments frequently**: Experience God's mercy first hand in the Sacraments of Reconciliation and His love in the Eucharist. Learn deeply what each Sacrament means in the Catholic understanding of love especially Holy Communion, Confession/Reconciliation/Penance and Holy Matrimony/Holy Orders.
4. **Study the faith**: Read Scripture, the Catechism, and Church documents on love and relationships. The Bible in a Year and The Catechism in a Year by Father Mike Schmitz are amazing gifts to our Faith.
5. **Build Catholic community**: Share this vision with fellow parishioners through Bible studies or faith-sharing groups
6. **Be part of the 'New Evangelization'**: Make evangelization (by living and sharing the Catholic understanding of love) a part of your daily life. ALWAYS in complete charity attempting to demonstrate the love of Christ, His truth, His justice and His mercy. An argument will only push people away.
   - in every conversation
   - in every action
   - in every decision
   - in every relationship
   - in every vocation
7. **Live the faith**: Live the faith in your daily life.  Look for places where you are not applying justice and mercy the way God would want you to.
8. **Pray the rosary**: Pray the rosary daily.  This is another form of prayer and immersing yourself in contemplating the sacrificial, covenantal, and communal love of Jesus.
9. **Learn Catholic Apologetics** - Learn to reason properly about the teachings of the Faith. This will help you to see both sides and understand the Catholic understanding of love much more clearly.
10. **Raise a good Catholic Family** - Raise a family that is a reflection of the Catholic understanding of love.
11. **Send your kids to faithful Catholic schools and universities**: A great resource for this is the Cardinal Newman Society - https://www.cardinalnewmansociety.org.

## Conclusion

As faithful Catholics in today's world, we possess a treasure in our Church's understanding of love as the sacred, sacrificial gift of covenant which binds true justice and mercy into life-giving communion. This integrated vision not only deepens our own faith but provides a compelling alternative to the fragmented understandings of love prevalent in our culture.

When we live and share this vision, we follow Christ's command to "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind" (Matthew 22:37) and to be "salt of the earth and light of the world" (Matthew 5:13-14). Catholicism offers a positive vision—one that responds to the deepest longings of the human heart and provides a path toward authentic communion with God and neighbor.

In a world desperately seeking love but often looking in the wrong places, we as Catholics are called to be witnesses to love's true nature—not just in what we say, but in how we live. May our lives increasingly reflect this integrated love, drawing others to the One who is Love itself.
